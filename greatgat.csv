0,”      Thomas Parke d’Invilliers                                        I    In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice  that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since
1,"    “Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just  remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages  that you’ve had"
2,"”    He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative  in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more  than that"
3," In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a  habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me  the victim of not a few veteran bores"
4," The abnormal mind is quick to  detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal  person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of  being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,  unknown men"
5," Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have  feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by  some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on  the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least  the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and  marred by obvious suppressions"
6, Reserving judgements is a matter of  infinite hope
7," I am still a little afraid of missing something if I  forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly  repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out  unequally at birth"
8,"    And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission  that it has a limit"
9," Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the  wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded  on"
10, When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted  the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I  wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the  human heart
11," Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was  exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I  have an unaffected scorn"
12," If personality is an unbroken series of  successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some  heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related  to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten  thousand miles away"
13," This responsiveness had nothing to do with that  flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the  “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a  romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and  which it is not likely I shall ever find again"
14," No—Gatsby turned out  all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust  floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my  interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men"
15,"    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle  Western city for three generations"
16," The Carraways are something of a  clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of  Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s  brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil  War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father  carries on today"
17,"    I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with  special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in  father’s office"
18," I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of  a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that  delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War"
19, I enjoyed the  counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless
20," Instead of being  the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the  ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond  business"
21," Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it  could support one more single man"
22," All my aunts and uncles talked it  over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said,  “Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces"
23," Father agreed to finance  me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I  thought, in the spring of twenty-two"
24,"    The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm  season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly  trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a  house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea"
25," He  found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a  month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and  I went out to the country alone"
26," I had a dog—at least I had him for a  few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who  made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to  herself over the electric stove"
27,"    It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more  recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road"
28,    “How do you get to West Egg village
29,” he asked helplessly
30,    I told him
31, And as I walked on I was lonely no longer
32," I was a guide,  a pathfinder, an original settler"
33, He had casually conferred on me the  freedom of the neighbourhood
34,"    And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the  trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar  conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer"
35,"    There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to  be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air"
36," I bought a dozen  volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they  stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint,  promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and  Maecenas knew"
37, And I had the high intention of reading many other  books besides
38," I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a  series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now  I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become  again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man"
39,"”  This isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at  from a single window, after all"
40,    It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of  the strangest communities in North America
41," It was on that slender  riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where  there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of  land"
42," Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in  contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most  domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great  wet barnyard of Long Island Sound"
43," They are not perfect ovals—like the  egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact  end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual  wonder to the gulls that fly overhead"
44, To the wingless a more  interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular  except shape and size
45,"    I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though  this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little  sinister contrast between them"
46," My house was at the very tip of the  egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge  places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season"
47," The one on  my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual  imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one  side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble  swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden"
48, It was  Gatsby’s mansion
49," Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr"
50," Gatsby, it was a  mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name"
51," My own house was an  eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I  had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and  the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a  month"
52,"    Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg  glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins  on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom  Buchanans"
53," Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom  in college"
54, And just after the war I spent two days with them in  Chicago
55,"    Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of  the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a  national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute  limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of  anticlimax"
56," His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his  freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago  and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for  instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake  Forest"
57, It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was  wealthy enough to do that
58,    Why they came East I don’t know
59," They had spent a year in France for  no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully  wherever people played polo and were rich together"
60," This was a  permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe  it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift  on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of  some irrecoverable football game"
61,    And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East  Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all
62," Their house  was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white  Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay"
63," The lawn started at  the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile,  jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when  it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though  from the momentum of its run"
64," The front was broken by a line of French  windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm  windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with  his legs apart on the front porch"
65,    He had changed since his New Haven years
66," Now he was a sturdy  straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a  supercilious manner"
67, Two shining arrogant eyes had established  dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning  aggressively forward
68," Not even the effeminate swank of his riding  clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill  those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could  see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his  thin coat"
69, It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body
70,"    His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of  fractiousness he conveyed"
71," There was a touch of paternal contempt in  it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who  had hated his guts"
72,"    “Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to  say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are"
73,"” We  were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I  always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like  him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own"
74,    We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch
75,"    “I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about  restlessly"
76,"    Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the  front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half  acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped  the tide offshore"
77,"    “It belonged to Demaine, the oil man"
78,"” He turned me around again,  politely and abruptly"
79, “We’ll go inside
80,"”    We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space,  fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end"
81, The  windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside  that seemed to grow a little way into the house
82," A breeze blew through  the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale  flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the  ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow  on it as wind does on the sea"
83,    The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous  couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an  anchored balloon
84," They were both in white, and their dresses were  rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a  short flight around the house"
85, I must have stood for a few moments  listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a  picture on the wall
86," Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the  rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the  curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the  floor"
87,    The younger of the two was a stranger to me
88," She was extended full  length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her  chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which  was quite likely to fall"
89," If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes  she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring  an apology for having disturbed her by coming in"
90,"    The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly  forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd,  charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the  room"
91,    “I’m p-paralysed with happiness
92,"”    She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my  hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was  no one in the world she so much wanted to see"
93, That was a way she  had
94, She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was  Baker
95, (I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people  lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less  charming
96,")    At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost  imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object  she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her  something of a fright"
97, Again a sort of apology arose to my lips
98,  Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned  tribute from me
99,"    I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low,  thrilling voice"
100," It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and  down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be  played again"
101," Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,  bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement  in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:  a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had  done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,  exciting things hovering in the next hour"
102,"    I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East,  and how a dozen people had sent their love through me"
103,    “Do they miss me
104,” she cried ecstatically
105,    “The whole town is desolate
106," All the cars have the left rear wheel  painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all  night along the north shore"
107,”    “How gorgeous
108," Let’s go back, Tom"
109, Tomorrow
110,” Then she added  irrelevantly: “You ought to see the baby
111,”    “I’d like to
112,”    “She’s asleep
113, She’s three years old
114, Haven’t you ever seen her
115,”    “Never
116,"”    “Well, you ought to see her"
117," She’s—”    Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped  and rested his hand on my shoulder"
118,"    “What you doing, Nick"
119,”    “I’m a bond man
120,”    “Who with
121,”    I told him
122,"    “Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively"
123,    This annoyed me
124,"    “You will,” I answered shortly"
125, “You will if you stay in the East
126,"”    “Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at  Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something  more"
127, “I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else
128,”    At this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely
129,” with such suddenness that  I started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the  room
130," Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned  and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room"
131,"    “I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long  as I can remember"
132,"”    “Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get you to  New York all afternoon"
133,"”    “No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the  pantry"
134, “I’m absolutely in training
135,”    Her host looked at her incredulously
136,    “You are
137,” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom  of a glass
138, “How you ever get anything done is beyond me
139,"”    I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done"
140,” I  enjoyed looking at her
141," She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with  an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward  at the shoulders like a young cadet"
142," Her grey sun-strained eyes looked  back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming,  discontented face"
143," It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a  picture of her, somewhere before"
144,"    “You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously"
145, “I know somebody  there
146,”    “I don’t know a single—”    “You must know Gatsby
147,”    “Gatsby
148,” demanded Daisy
149, “What Gatsby
150,"”    Before I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced;  wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled  me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square"
151,"    Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two  young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward  the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the  diminished wind"
152,    “Why candles
153,"” objected Daisy, frowning"
154, She snapped them out with her  fingers
155, “In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year
156,” She  looked at us all radiantly
157, “Do you always watch for the longest day  of the year and then miss it
158, I always watch for the longest day in  the year and then miss it
159,"”    “We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the  table as if she were getting into bed"
160,"    “All right,” said Daisy"
161, “What’ll we plan
162,” She turned to me  helplessly: “What do people plan
163,”    Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her  little finger
164,    “Look
165,” she complained; “I hurt it
166,”    We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue
167,"    “You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly"
168," “I know you didn’t mean to,  but you did do it"
169," That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a  great, big, hulking physical specimen of a—”    “I hate that word ‘hulking,’ ” objected Tom crossly, “even in  kidding"
170,"”    “Hulking,” insisted Daisy"
171,"    Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a  bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool  as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all  desire"
172," They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a  polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained"
173, They knew  that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too  would be over and casually put away
174," It was sharply different from the  West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its  close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer  nervous dread of the moment itself"
175,"    “You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass  of corky but rather impressive claret"
176, “Can’t you talk about crops or  something
177,"”    I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in  an unexpected way"
178,"    “Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently"
179, “I’ve  gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things
180, Have you read The Rise  of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard
181,"”    “Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone"
182,"    “Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it"
183, The idea is  if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly  submerged
184, It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved
185,"”    “Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of  unthoughtful sadness"
186, “He reads deep books with long words in  them
187," What was that word we—”    “Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her  impatiently"
188, “This fellow has worked out the whole thing
189," It’s up to  us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will  have control of things"
190,"”    “We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously  toward the fervent sun"
191,"    “You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom  interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair"
192,    “This idea is that we’re Nordics
193," I am, and you are, and you are,  and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a  slight nod, and she winked at me again"
194," “—And we’ve produced all the  things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all  that"
195, Do you see
196,"”    There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his  complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more"
197,"  When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler  left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned  towards me"
198,"    “I’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically"
199,  “It’s about the butler’s nose
200, Do you want to hear about the butler’s  nose
201,”    “That’s why I came over tonight
202,"”    “Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher  for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred  people"
203," He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it  began to affect his nose—”    “Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker"
204,    “Yes
205," Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up  his position"
206,"”    For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her  glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I  listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering  regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk"
207,"    The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear,  whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went  inside"
208," As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned  forward again, her voice glowing and singing"
209,"    “I love to see you at my table, Nick"
210," You remind me of a—of a rose, an  absolute rose"
211, Doesn’t he
212,” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation:  “An absolute rose
213,”    This was untrue
214, I am not even faintly like a rose
215," She was only  extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart  was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless,  thrilling words"
216, Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and  excused herself and went into the house
217,    Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of  meaning
218, I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “Sh
219,”  in a warning voice
220," A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the  room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to  hear"
221," The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down,  mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether"
222,    “This Mr
223, Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—” I began
224,    “Don’t talk
225, I want to hear what happens
226,”    “Is something happening
227,” I inquired innocently
228,    “You mean to say you don’t know
229,"” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised"
230,  “I thought everybody knew
231,”    “I don’t
232,”    “Why—” she said hesitantly
233, “Tom’s got some woman in New York
234,”    “Got some woman
235,” I repeated blankly
236,    Miss Baker nodded
237,    “She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time
238,  Don’t you think
239,"”    Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a  dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at  the table"
240,    “It couldn’t be helped
241,” cried Daisy with tense gaiety
242,"    She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and  continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic  outdoors"
243, There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a  nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line
244," He’s singing  away—” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom"
245,"”    “Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light  enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables"
246,"”    The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head  decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects,  vanished into air"
247," Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes  at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I  was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to  avoid all eyes"
248," I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but  I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain  hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill  metallic urgency out of mind"
249, To a certain temperament the situation  might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone  immediately for the police
250,"    The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again"
251," Tom and Miss  Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into  the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while,  trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed  Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front"
252, In  its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee
253,"    Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and  her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk"
254," I saw that  turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be  some sedative questions about her little girl"
255,"    “We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly"
256, “Even  if we are cousins
257, You didn’t come to my wedding
258,”    “I wasn’t back from the war
259,”    “That’s true
260,” She hesitated
261," “Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick,  and I’m pretty cynical about everything"
262,”    Evidently she had reason to be
263," I waited but she didn’t say any more,  and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her  daughter"
264,"    “I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything"
265,"”    “Oh, yes"
266,” She looked at me absently
267," “Listen, Nick; let me tell you  what I said when she was born"
268, Would you like to hear
269,”    “Very much
270,”    “It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things
271," Well, she was  less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where"
272," I woke up out of  the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right  away if it was a boy or a girl"
273," She told me it was a girl, and so I  turned my head away and wept"
274," ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a  girl"
275," And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be  in this world, a beautiful little fool"
276,"’    “You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a  convinced way"
277, “Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people
278, And I  know
279, I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything
280,"”  Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and  she laughed with thrilling scorn"
281," “Sophisticated—God, I’m  sophisticated"
282,"”    The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my  belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said"
283," It made me  uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to  exact a contributory emotion from me"
284," I waited, and sure enough, in a  moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as  if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret  society to which she and Tom belonged"
285,"    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light"
286," Tom and Miss Baker sat at  either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the  Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running  together in a soothing tune"
287," The lamplight, bright on his boots and  dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as  she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms"
288,    When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand
289,"    “To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in  our very next issue"
290,"”    Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she  stood up"
291,"    “Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the  ceiling"
292, “Time for this good girl to go to bed
293,"”    “Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy,  “over at Westchester"
294,”    “Oh—you’re Jordan Baker
295,”    I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous  expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the  sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach
296," I had heard  some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I  had forgotten long ago"
297,"    “Good night,” she said softly"
298," “Wake me at eight, won’t you"
299,”    “If you’ll get up
300,”    “I will
301," Good night, Mr"
302, Carraway
303, See you anon
304,"”    “Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy"
305, “In fact I think I’ll arrange a  marriage
306," Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of—oh—fling you  together"
307," You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push  you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—”    “Good night,” called Miss Baker from the stairs"
308, “I haven’t heard a  word
309,"”    “She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment"
310, “They oughtn’t to let  her run around the country this way
311,”    “Who oughtn’t to
312,” inquired Daisy coldly
313,    “Her family
314,”    “Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old
315," Besides, Nick’s  going to look after her, aren’t you, Nick"
316, She’s going to spend lots  of weekends out here this summer
317, I think the home influence will be  very good for her
318,”    Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence
319,    “Is she from New York
320,” I asked quickly
321,    “From Louisville
322, Our white girlhood was passed together there
323, Our  beautiful white—”    “Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda
324,”  demanded Tom suddenly
325,    “Did I
326,” She looked at me
327," “I can’t seem to remember, but I think we  talked about the Nordic race"
328," Yes, I’m sure we did"
329," It sort of crept  up on us and first thing you know—”    “Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me"
330,"    I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes  later I got up to go home"
331, They came to the door with me and stood  side by side in a cheerful square of light
332, As I started my motor  Daisy peremptorily called: “Wait
333,"”    “I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important"
334, We heard you were  engaged to a girl out West
335,"”    “That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly"
336, “We heard that you were  engaged
337,”    “It’s a libel
338, I’m too poor
339,"”    “But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again  in a flower-like way"
340," “We heard it from three people, so it must be  true"
341,"”    Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even  vaguely engaged"
342, The fact that gossip had published the banns was one  of the reasons I had come East
343," You can’t stop going with an old  friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention  of being rumoured into marriage"
344,"    Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely  rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove  away"
345," It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out  of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such  intentions in her head"
346," As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman  in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been  depressed by a book"
347, Something was making him nibble at the edge of  stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his  peremptory heart
348,"    Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside  garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and  when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and  sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard"
349," The wind had  blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the  trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth  blew the frogs full of life"
350," The silhouette of a moving cat wavered  across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I  was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of  my neighbour’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets  regarding the silver pepper of the stars"
351, Something in his leisurely  movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested  that it was Mr
352," Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was  his of our local heavens"
353,    I decided to call to him
354," Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and  that would do for an introduction"
355," But I didn’t call to him, for he  gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched  out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was  from him, I could have sworn he was trembling"
356," Involuntarily I glanced  seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute  and far away, that might have been the end of a dock"
357," When I looked  once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the  unquiet darkness"
358,"                                        II    About halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily  joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as  to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land"
359," This is a valley  of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and  hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and  chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of  ash-grey men, who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery  air"
360," Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track,  gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the  ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable  cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight"
361,"    But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift  endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T"
362,  J
363, Eckleburg
364, The eyes of Doctor T
365, J
366, Eckleburg are blue and  gigantic—their retinas are one yard high
367," They look out of no face,  but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass  over a nonexistent nose"
368," Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set  them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then  sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved  away"
369," But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun  and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground"
370,"    The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and,  when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on  waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an  hour"
371," There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was  because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress"
372,    The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known
373," His  acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular cafés  with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with  whomsoever he knew"
374," Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire  to meet her—but I did"
375," I went up to New York with Tom on the train one  afternoon, and when we stopped by the ash-heaps he jumped to his feet  and, taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car"
376,"    “We’re getting off,” he insisted"
377, “I want you to meet my girl
378,"”    I think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination  to have my company bordered on violence"
379, The supercilious assumption  was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do
380,"    I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked  back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg’s  persistent stare"
381," The only building in sight was a small block of  yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact  Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing"
382,"  One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an  all-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a  garage—Repairs"
383, George B
384, Wilson
385, Cars bought and sold
386,—and I followed  Tom inside
387,    The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the  dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner
388," It had  occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and that  sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead, when the  proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands  on a piece of waste"
389," He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and  faintly handsome"
390, When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his  light blue eyes
391,"    “Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping him jovially on the  shoulder"
392, “How’s business
393,"”    “I can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvincingly"
394, “When are you  going to sell me that car
395,”    “Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now
396,"”    “Works pretty slow, don’t he"
397,"”    “No, he doesn’t,” said Tom coldly"
398," “And if you feel that way about it,  maybe I’d better sell it somewhere else after all"
399,"”    “I don’t mean that,” explained Wilson quickly"
400, “I just meant—”    His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage
401,"  Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish  figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door"
402," She was  in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her flesh  sensuously as some women can"
403," Her face, above a spotted dress of dark  blue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there  was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of  her body were continually smouldering"
404," She smiled slowly and, walking  through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom,  looking him flush in the eye"
405," Then she wet her lips, and without  turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:    “Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down"
406,"”    “Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little  office, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls"
407," A  white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled  everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom"
408,"    “I want to see you,” said Tom intently"
409, “Get on the next train
410,”    “All right
411,”    “I’ll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level
412,”    She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with  two chairs from his office door
413,    We waited for her down the road and out of sight
414," It was a few days  before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was  setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track"
415,"    “Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor  Eckleburg"
416,    “Awful
417,”    “It does her good to get away
418,”    “Doesn’t her husband object
419,”    “Wilson
420, He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York
421, He’s so  dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive
422,"”    So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not  quite together, for Mrs"
423, Wilson sat discreetly in another car
424, Tom  deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might  be on the train
425,"    She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched  tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in  New York"
426," At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a  moving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream  and a small flask of perfume"
427," Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive  she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one,  lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from  the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine"
428," But immediately she  turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the  front glass"
429,"    “I want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly"
430, “I want to get  one for the apartment
431, They’re nice to have—a dog
432,”    We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John  D
433, Rockefeller
434, In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very  recent puppies of an indeterminate breed
435,    “What kind are they
436,” asked Mrs
437," Wilson eagerly, as he came to the  taxi-window"
438,    “All kinds
439," What kind do you want, lady"
440,”    “I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got  that kind
441,"”    The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and  drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck"
442,"    “That’s no police dog,” said Tom"
443,"    “No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment  in his voice"
444, “It’s more of an Airedale
445,” He passed his hand over the  brown washrag of a back
446, “Look at that coat
447, Some coat
448, That’s a dog  that’ll never bother you with catching cold
449,"”    “I think it’s cute,” said Mrs"
450, Wilson enthusiastically
451, “How much is  it
452,”    “That dog
453,” He looked at it admiringly
454, “That dog will cost you ten  dollars
455,"”    The Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it  somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and  settled down into Mrs"
456," Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the  weatherproof coat with rapture"
457,    “Is it a boy or a girl
458,” she asked delicately
459,    “That dog
460, That dog’s a boy
461,"”    “It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively"
462, “Here’s your money
463, Go and buy  ten more dogs with it
464,"”    We drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the  summer Sunday afternoon"
465, I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great  flock of white sheep turn the corner
466,"    “Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you here"
467,"”    “No you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly"
468, “Myrtle’ll be hurt if you  don’t come up to the apartment
469," Won’t you, Myrtle"
470,"”    “Come on,” she urged"
471, “I’ll telephone my sister Catherine
472, She’s said  to be very beautiful by people who ought to know
473,"”    “Well, I’d like to, but—”    We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds"
474,  At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of  apartment-houses
475," Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the  neighbourhood, Mrs"
476," Wilson gathered up her dog and her other  purchases, and went haughtily in"
477,"    “I’m going to have the McKees come up,” she announced as we rose in  the elevator"
478," “And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too"
479,"”    The apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small  dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath"
480," The living-room was crowded  to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for  it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of  ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles"
481," The only picture was an  over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock"
482,"  Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a  bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the  room"
483," Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with  a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines  of Broadway"
484, Mrs
485, Wilson was first concerned with the dog
486," A reluctant  elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he  added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog biscuits—one of  which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all  afternoon"
487, Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked  bureau door
488,"    I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that  afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it,  although until after eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerful  sun"
489, Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs
490," Wilson called up several people on the  telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some  at the drugstore on the corner"
491," When I came back they had both  disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a  chapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was terrible stuff or the  whisky distorted things, because it didn’t make any sense to me"
492,    Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs
493," Wilson and I called  each other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive  at the apartment door"
494,"    The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty,  with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky  white"
495," Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more  rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the  old alignment gave a blurred air to her face"
496, When she moved about  there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets  jingled up and down upon her arms
497," She came in with such a proprietary  haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I  wondered if she lived here"
498," But when I asked her she laughed  immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a  girl friend at a hotel"
499,    Mr
500," McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below"
501," He had just  shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he  was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room"
502," He  informed me that he was in the “artistic game,” and I gathered later  that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of  Mrs"
503, Wilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall
504," His  wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible"
505, She told me with  pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven  times since they had been married
506,    Mrs
507," Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now  attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon,  which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room"
508, With  the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a  change
509, The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage  was converted into impressive hauteur
510," Her laughter, her gestures, her  assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she  expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be  revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air"
511,"    “My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, “most of  these fellas will cheat you every time"
512, All they think of is money
513," I  had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me  the bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis out"
514,”    “What was the name of the woman
515,” asked Mrs
516, McKee
517,    “Mrs
518, Eberhardt
519, She goes around looking at people’s feet in their own  homes
520,"”    “I like your dress,” remarked Mrs"
521," McKee, “I think it’s adorable"
522,”    Mrs
523, Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain
524,"    “It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said"
525, “I just slip it on sometimes  when I don’t care what I look like
526,"”    “But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,” pursued Mrs"
527,  McKee
528, “If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could  make something of it
529,”    We all looked in silence at Mrs
530," Wilson, who removed a strand of hair  from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile"
531, Mr
532,"  McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved  his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face"
533,"    “I should change the light,” he said after a moment"
534, “I’d like to  bring out the modelling of the features
535, And I’d try to get hold of  all the back hair
536,"”    “I wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried Mrs"
537, McKee
538, “I think  it’s—”    Her husband said “Sh
539,"” and we all looked at the subject again,  whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet"
540,"    “You McKees have something to drink,” he said"
541," “Get some more ice and  mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep"
542,”    “I told that boy about the ice
543,” Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair  at the shiftlessness of the lower orders
544, “These people
545, You have to  keep after them all the time
546,”    She looked at me and laughed pointlessly
547," Then she flounced over to  the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying  that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there"
548,"    “I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,” asserted Mr"
549, McKee
550,    Tom looked at him blankly
551,    “Two of them we have framed downstairs
552,”    “Two what
553,” demanded Tom
554,    “Two studies
555," One of them I call Montauk Point—The Gulls, and the  other I call Montauk Point—The Sea"
556,”    The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch
557,"    “Do you live down on Long Island, too"
558,” she inquired
559,    “I live at West Egg
560,”    “Really
561, I was down there at a party about a month ago
562, At a man named  Gatsby’s
563, Do you know him
564,”    “I live next door to him
565,"”    “Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s"
566, That’s  where all his money comes from
567,”    “Really
568,”    She nodded
569,    “I’m scared of him
570, I’d hate to have him get anything on me
571,”    This absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs
572,"  McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine:    “Chester, I think you could do something with her,” she broke out, but  Mr"
573," McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom"
574,"    “I’d like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry"
575,  All I ask is that they should give me a start
576,"”    “Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as  Mrs"
577, Wilson entered with a tray
578," “She’ll give you a letter of  introduction, won’t you, Myrtle"
579,”    “Do what
580,"” she asked, startled"
581,"    “You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can  do some studies of him"
582,"” His lips moved silently for a moment as he  invented, “ ‘George B"
583," Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,’ or something like  that"
584,”    Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear:    “Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to
585,”    “Can’t they
586,”    “Can’t stand them
587,” She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom
588," “What I say  is, why go on living with them if they can’t stand them"
589, If I was them  I’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away
590,”    “Doesn’t she like Wilson either
591,”    The answer to this was unexpected
592," It came from Myrtle, who had  overheard the question, and it was violent and obscene"
593,"    “You see,” cried Catherine triumphantly"
594, She lowered her voice again
595,  “It’s really his wife that’s keeping them apart
596," She’s a Catholic, and  they don’t believe in divorce"
597,"”    Daisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the  elaborateness of the lie"
598,"    “When they do get married,” continued Catherine, “they’re going West  to live for a while until it blows over"
599,”    “It’d be more discreet to go to Europe
600,"”    “Oh, do you like Europe"
601,” she exclaimed surprisingly
602, “I just got back  from Monte Carlo
603,”    “Really
604,”    “Just last year
605, I went over there with another girl
606,”    “Stay long
607,"”    “No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back"
608, We went by way of  Marseilles
609," We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we  got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms"
610," We had an  awful time getting back, I can tell you"
611," God, how I hated that town"
612,”    The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the  blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs
613, McKee  called me back into the room
614,"    “I almost made a mistake, too,” she declared vigorously"
615, “I almost  married a little kike who’d been after me for years
616, I knew he was  below me
617," Everybody kept saying to me: ‘Lucille, that man’s way below  you"
618,"’ But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d of got me sure"
619,"”    “Yes, but listen,” said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down,  “at least you didn’t marry him"
620,”    “I know I didn’t
621,"”    “Well, I married him,” said Myrtle, ambiguously"
622, “And that’s the  difference between your case and mine
623,"”    “Why did you, Myrtle"
624,” demanded Catherine
625, “Nobody forced you to
626,”    Myrtle considered
627,"    “I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,” she said  finally"
628," “I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn’t  fit to lick my shoe"
629,"”    “You were crazy about him for a while,” said Catherine"
630,    “Crazy about him
631,” cried Myrtle incredulously
632, “Who said I was crazy  about him
633, I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that  man there
634,"”    She pointed suddenly at me, and everyone looked at me accusingly"
635, I  tried to show by my expression that I expected no affection
636,    “The only crazy I was was when I married him
637, I knew right away I made  a mistake
638," He borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married in, and  never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he  was out: ‘Oh, is that your suit"
639,’ I said
640, ‘This is the first I ever  heard about it
641,’ But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to  beat the band all afternoon
642,"”    “She really ought to get away from him,” resumed Catherine to me"
643,  “They’ve been living over that garage for eleven years
644, And Tom’s the  first sweetie she ever had
645,"”    The bottle of whisky—a second one—was now in constant demand by all  present, excepting Catherine, who “felt just as good on nothing at  all"
646,"” Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated  sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves"
647," I wanted to  get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight,  but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident  argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair"
648," Yet  high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed  their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening  streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering"
649," I was within and  without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible  variety of life"
650,"    Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath  poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom"
651,    “It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the  last ones left on the train
652, I was going up to New York to see my  sister and spend the night
653," He had on a dress suit and patent leather  shoes, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked  at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his  head"
654," When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white  shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call  a policeman, but he knew I lied"
655, I was so excited that when I got into  a taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting into a subway  train
656," All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t live  forever; you can’t live forever"
657,’ ”    She turned to Mrs
658, McKee and the room rang full of her artificial  laughter
659,"    “My dear,” she cried, “I’m going to give you this dress as soon as I’m  through with it"
660, I’ve got to get another one tomorrow
661, I’m going to  make a list of all the things I’ve got to get
662," A massage and a wave,  and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays where  you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s  grave that’ll last all summer"
663, I got to write down a list so I won’t  forget all the things I got to do
664,”    It was nine o’clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch  and found it was ten
665, Mr
666," McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists  clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action"
667, Taking out  my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that  had worried me all the afternoon
668,"    The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes  through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly"
669," People  disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost  each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet  away"
670, Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs
671," Wilson stood  face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs"
672, Wilson  had any right to mention Daisy’s name
673,    “Daisy
674, Daisy
675, Daisy
676,” shouted Mrs
677, Wilson
678, “I’ll say it whenever I  want to
679, Daisy
680," Dai—”    Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his  open hand"
681,"    Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women’s  voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of  pain"
682, Mr
683, McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the  door
684," When he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the  scene—his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled  here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and  the despairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and trying to  spread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of  Versailles"
685, Then Mr
686, McKee turned and continued on out the door
687,"  Taking my hat from the chandelier, I followed"
688,"    “Come to lunch some day,” he suggested, as we groaned down in the  elevator"
689,    “Where
690,”    “Anywhere
691,"”    “Keep your hands off the lever,” snapped the elevator boy"
692,"    “I beg your pardon,” said Mr"
693," McKee with dignity, “I didn’t know I was  touching it"
694,"”    “All right,” I agreed, “I’ll be glad to"
695,"”    … I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the  sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands"
696,"    “Beauty and the Beast … Loneliness … Old Grocery Horse … Brook’n  Bridge …”    Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the  Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning Tribune, and waiting for  the four o’clock train"
697,                                       III    There was music from my neighbour’s house through the summer nights
698,  In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the  whisperings and the champagne and the stars
699," At high tide in the  afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or  taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats  slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of  foam"
700," On weekends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties  to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past  midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to  meet all trains"
701," And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra  gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers  and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before"
702,    Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a  fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left  his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves
703, There was a machine in  the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in  half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a  butler’s thumb
704,    At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several  hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas  tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden
705," On buffet tables, garnished with  glistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of  harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark  gold"
706," In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and  stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that  most of his female guests were too young to know one from another"
707,"    By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair,  but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and  cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums"
708," The last swimmers have  come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from  New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and  salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours, and hair bobbed in  strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile"
709," The bar is  in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden  outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual  innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic  meetings between women who never knew each other’s names"
710,"    The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and  now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of  voices pitches a key higher"
711," Laughter is easier minute by minute,  spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word"
712," The groups  change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the  same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave  here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,  joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph,  glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour under  the constantly changing light"
713,"    Suddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail  out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like  Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform"
714," A momentary hush; the  orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a  burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda  Gray’s understudy from the Follies"
715, The party has begun
716,    I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby’s house I was one  of the few guests who had actually been invited
717, People were not  invited—they went there
718," They got into automobiles which bore them out  to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s door"
719," Once there  they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after that they  conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated  with an amusement park"
720," Sometimes they came and went without having  met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that  was its own ticket of admission"
721,    I had been actually invited
722," A chauffeur in a uniform of robin’s-egg  blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly  formal note from his employer: the honour would be entirely Gatsby’s,  it said, if I would attend his “little party” that night"
723," He had seen  me several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but a  peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it—signed Jay  Gatsby, in a majestic hand"
724,"    Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after  seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies  of people I didn’t know—though here and there was a face I had noticed  on the commuting train"
725," I was immediately struck by the number of  young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little  hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous  Americans"
726, I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or  insurance or automobiles
727, They were at least agonizingly aware of the  easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few  words in the right key
728,"    As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or  three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an  amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements,  that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place  in the garden where a single man could linger without looking  purposeless and alone"
729,"    I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when  Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble  steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous  interest down into the garden"
730,"    Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone  before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby"
731,    “Hello
732,"” I roared, advancing toward her"
733, My voice seemed unnaturally  loud across the garden
734,"    “I thought you might be here,” she responded absently as I came up"
735,"  “I remembered you lived next door to—”    She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of me  in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who  stopped at the foot of the steps"
736,    “Hello
737,” they cried together
738, “Sorry you didn’t win
739,”    That was for the golf tournament
740, She had lost in the finals the week  before
741,"    “You don’t know who we are,” said one of the girls in yellow, “but we  met you here about a month ago"
742,"”    “You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked Jordan, and I started,  but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to  the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a  caterer’s basket"
743," With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, we  descended the steps and sauntered about the garden"
744," A tray of  cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a  table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced  to us as Mr"
745, Mumble
746,    “Do you come to these parties often
747,” inquired Jordan of the girl  beside her
748,"    “The last one was the one I met you at,” answered the girl, in an  alert confident voice"
749," She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for  you, Lucille"
750,"”    It was for Lucille, too"
751,"    “I like to come,” Lucille said"
752," “I never care what I do, so I always  have a good time"
753," When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and  he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from  Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it"
754,”    “Did you keep it
755,” asked Jordan
756,    “Sure I did
757," I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the  bust and had to be altered"
758, It was gas blue with lavender beads
759, Two  hundred and sixty-five dollars
760,"”    “There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,”  said the other girl eagerly"
761, “He doesn’t want any trouble with  anybody
762,”    “Who doesn’t
763,” I inquired
764,    “Gatsby
765, Somebody told me—”    The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially
766,    “Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once
767,”    A thrill passed over all of us
768, The three Mr
769, Mumbles bent forward and  listened eagerly
770,"    “I don’t think it’s so much that,” argued Lucille sceptically; “It’s  more that he was a German spy during the war"
771,”    One of the men nodded in confirmation
772,"    “I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in  Germany,” he assured us positively"
773,"    “Oh, no,” said the first girl, “it couldn’t be that, because he was in  the American army during the war"
774,” As our credulity switched back to  her she leaned forward with enthusiasm
775, “You look at him sometimes  when he thinks nobody’s looking at him
776, I’ll bet he killed a man
777,”    She narrowed her eyes and shivered
778, Lucille shivered
779, We all turned  and looked around for Gatsby
780, It was testimony to the romantic  speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those  who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this  world
781,"    The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now  being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were  spread around a table on the other side of the garden"
782," There were  three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate  given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that  sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a  greater or lesser degree"
783," Instead of rambling, this party had  preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function  of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg  condescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against its  spectroscopic gaiety"
784,"    “Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and  inappropriate half-hour; “this is much too polite for me"
785,"”    We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I  had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy"
786," The  undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way"
787,"    The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not  there"
788," She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t  on the veranda"
789," On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and  walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak,  and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas"
790,"    A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was  sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with  unsteady concentration at the shelves of books"
791, As we entered he  wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot
792,    “What do you think
793,” he demanded impetuously
794,    “About what
795,”    He waved his hand toward the bookshelves
796,    “About that
797, As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain
798, I  ascertained
799, They’re real
800,”    “The books
801,”    He nodded
802,    “Absolutely real—have pages and everything
803, I thought they’d be a nice  durable cardboard
804," Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real"
805,  Pages  and—Here
806, Lemme show you
807,"”    Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and  returned with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures"
808,    “See
809,” he cried triumphantly
810, “It’s a bona-fide piece of printed  matter
811, It fooled me
812, This fella’s a regular Belasco
813, It’s a  triumph
814, What thoroughness
815, What realism
816," Knew when to stop,  too—didn’t cut the pages"
817, But what do you want
818, What do you expect
819,"”    He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf,  muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable  to collapse"
820,    “Who brought you
821,” he demanded
822, “Or did you just come
823, I was brought
824,  Most people were brought
825,"”    Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering"
826,"    “I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,” he continued"
827, “Mrs
828, Claud  Roosevelt
829, Do you know her
830, I met her somewhere last night
831," I’ve been  drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit  in a library"
832,”    “Has it
833,"”    “A little bit, I think"
834, I can’t tell yet
835, I’ve only been here an hour
836,  Did I tell you about the books
837, They’re real
838, They’re—”    “You told us
839,”    We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors
840,"    There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing  young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples  holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the  corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individually or  relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the  traps"
841, By midnight the hilarity had increased
842," A celebrated tenor had  sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and  between the numbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden,  while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky"
843," A  pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a  baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than  finger-bowls"
844," The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was  a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny  drip of the banjoes on the lawn"
845,    I was still with Jordan Baker
846," We were sitting at a table with a man  of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the  slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter"
847, I was enjoying  myself now
848," I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene  had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and  profound"
849,    At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled
850,"    “Your face is familiar,” he said politely"
851, “Weren’t you in the First  Division during the war
852,”    “Why yes
853, I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry
854,”    “I was in the Sixteenth until June nineteen-eighteen
855, I knew I’d seen  you somewhere before
856,"”    We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France"
857,"  Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just  bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning"
858,"    “Want to go with me, old sport"
859, Just near the shore along the Sound
860,”    “What time
861,”    “Any time that suits you best
862,”    It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked  around and smiled
863,    “Having a gay time now
864,” she inquired
865,    “Much better
866,” I turned again to my new acquaintance
867, “This is an  unusual party for me
868, I haven’t even seen the host
869," I live over  there—” I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and  this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation"
870,”    For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand
871,"    “I’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly"
872,    “What
873,” I exclaimed
874," “Oh, I beg your pardon"
875,"”    “I thought you knew, old sport"
876, I’m afraid I’m not a very good host
877,”    He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly
878," It was one  of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that  you may come across four or five times in life"
879," It faced—or seemed to  face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on  you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour"
880," It understood you  just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you  would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had  precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to  convey"
881," Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an  elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate  formality of speech just missed being absurd"
882, Some time before he  introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his  words with care
883,    Almost at the moment when Mr
884, Gatsby identified himself a butler  hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him  on the wire
885, He excused himself with a small bow that included each of  us in turn
886,"    “If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,” he urged me"
887,  “Excuse me
888, I will rejoin you later
889,”    When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure  her of my surprise
890, I had expected that Mr
891, Gatsby would be a florid  and corpulent person in his middle years
892,    “Who is he
893,” I demanded
894, “Do you know
895,”    “He’s just a man named Gatsby
896,"”    “Where is he from, I mean"
897, And what does he do
898,"”    “Now you’re started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile"
899,"  “Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man"
900,"”    A dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next  remark it faded away"
901,"    “However, I don’t believe it"
902,”    “Why not
903,"”    “I don’t know,” she insisted, “I just don’t think he went there"
904,"”    Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think he  killed a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity"
905, I would  have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from  the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York
906, That  was comprehensible
907, But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial  inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and  buy a palace on Long Island Sound
908,"    “Anyhow, he gives large parties,” said Jordan, changing the subject  with an urban distaste for the concrete"
909, “And I like large parties
910,  They’re so intimate
911, At small parties there isn’t any privacy
912,"”    There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra  leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden"
913,"    “Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried"
914, “At the request of Mr
915, Gatsby we are  going to play for you Mr
916," Vladmir Tostoff’s latest work, which  attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May"
917, If you read the  papers you know there was a big sensation
918,"” He smiled with jovial  condescension, and added: “Some sensation"
919,” Whereupon everybody  laughed
920,"    “The piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as ‘Vladmir Tostoff’s  Jazz History of the World"
921,’ ”    The nature of Mr
922," Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it  began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and  looking from one group to another with approving eyes"
923, His tanned skin  was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as  though it were trimmed every day
924, I could see nothing sinister about  him
925," I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him  off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as  the fraternal hilarity increased"
926," When the “Jazz History of the World”  was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a  puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into  men’s arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest their  falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched  Gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s  head for one link"
927,    “I beg your pardon
928,”    Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us
929,    “Miss Baker
930,” he inquired
931," “I beg your pardon, but Mr"
932, Gatsby would  like to speak to you alone
933,”    “With me
934,” she exclaimed in surprise
935,"    “Yes, madame"
936,"”    She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and  followed the butler toward the house"
937," I noticed that she wore her  evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a  jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk  upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings"
938,    I was alone and it was almost two
939," For some time confused and  intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which  overhung the terrace"
940," Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was now  engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who  implored me to join him, I went inside"
941,    The large room was full of people
942," One of the girls in yellow was  playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady  from a famous chorus, engaged in song"
943," She had drunk a quantity of  champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly,  that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was  weeping too"
944," Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with  gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering  soprano"
945," The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for  when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they  assumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow  black rivulets"
946," A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes  on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and  went off into a deep vinous sleep"
947,"    “She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,” explained a  girl at my elbow"
948,    I looked around
949, Most of the remaining women were now having fights  with men said to be their husbands
950," Even Jordan’s party, the quartet  from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension"
951," One of the men was  talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after  attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent  way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals  she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed:  “You promised"
952,” into his ear
953,    The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men
954, The hall  was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly  indignant wives
955, The wives were sympathizing with each other in  slightly raised voices
956,    “Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to go home
957,”    “Never heard anything so selfish in my life
958,”    “We’re always the first ones to leave
959,”    “So are we
960,"”    “Well, we’re almost the last tonight,” said one of the men sheepishly"
961,  “The orchestra left half an hour ago
962,"”    In spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence was beyond  credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives  were lifted, kicking, into the night"
963,    As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and  Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together
964," He was saying some last  word to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into  formality as several people approached him to say goodbye"
965,"    Jordan’s party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she  lingered for a moment to shake hands"
966,"    “I’ve just heard the most amazing thing,” she whispered"
967, “How long  were we in there
968,"”    “Why, about an hour"
969,"”    “It was … simply amazing,” she repeated abstractedly"
970, “But I swore I  wouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you
971,” She yawned gracefully  in my face
972, “Please come and see me … Phone book … Under the name of  Mrs
973, Sigourney Howard … My aunt …” She was hurrying off as she  talked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her  party at the door
974,"    Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I  joined the last of Gatsby’s guests, who were clustered around him"
975, I  wanted to explain that I’d hunted for him early in the evening and to  apologize for not having known him in the garden
976,"    “Don’t mention it,” he enjoined me eagerly"
977," “Don’t give it another  thought, old sport"
978,” The familiar expression held no more familiarity  than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder
979," “And don’t  forget we’re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine  o’clock"
980,"”    Then the butler, behind his shoulder:    “Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir"
981,"”    “All right, in a minute"
982, Tell them I’ll be right there … Good night
983,”    “Good night
984,”    “Good night
985,"” He smiled—and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant  significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired  it all the time"
986," “Good night, old sport … Good night"
987,”    But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite  over
988, Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a  bizarre and tumultuous scene
989," In the ditch beside the road, right side  up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had  left Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before"
990," The sharp jut of a wall  accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting  considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs"
991," However,  as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din  from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to  the already violent confusion of the scene"
992,"    A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in  the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from the  tyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way"
993,    “See
994,” he explained
995, “It went in the ditch
996,"”    The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the  unusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of  Gatsby’s library"
997,    “How’d it happen
998,”    He shrugged his shoulders
999,"    “I know nothing whatever about mechanics,” he said decisively"
1000,    “But how did it happen
1001, Did you run into the wall
1002,"”    “Don’t ask me,” said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole  matter"
1003, “I know very little about driving—next to nothing
1004," It  happened, and that’s all I know"
1005,"”    “Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night"
1006,"”    “But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained indignantly, “I wasn’t even  trying"
1007,”    An awed hush fell upon the bystanders
1008,    “Do you want to commit suicide
1009,”    “You’re lucky it was just a wheel
1010, A bad driver and not even trying
1011,"”    “You don’t understand,” explained the criminal"
1012, “I wasn’t driving
1013,  There’s another man in the car
1014,”    The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained  “Ah-h-h
1015,” as the door of the coupé swung slowly open
1016," The crowd—it was  now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened  wide there was a ghostly pause"
1017," Then, very gradually, part by part, a  pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively  at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe"
1018,"    Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant  groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment  before he perceived the man in the duster"
1019,    “Wha’s matter
1020,” he inquired calmly
1021, “Did we run outa gas
1022,”    “Look
1023,"”    Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it  for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it  had dropped from the sky"
1024,"    “It came off,” someone explained"
1025,    He nodded
1026,    “At first I din’ notice we’d stopped
1027,”    A pause
1028," Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders,  he remarked in a determined voice:    “Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station"
1029,"”    At least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was,  explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any  physical bond"
1030,"    “Back out,” he suggested after a moment"
1031, “Put her in reverse
1032,”    “But the wheel’s off
1033,”    He hesitated
1034,"    “No harm in trying,” he said"
1035,    The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and  cut across the lawn toward home
1036, I glanced back once
1037," A wafer of a  moon was shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night fine as before,  and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden"
1038,"  A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great  doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who  stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell"
1039,"    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the  impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were  all that absorbed me"
1040," On the contrary, they were merely casual events  in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me  infinitely less than my personal affairs"
1041,    Most of the time I worked
1042, In the early morning the sun threw my  shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York  to the Probity Trust
1043," I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen  by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded  restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee"
1044," I  even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and  worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing  mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I  let it blow quietly away"
1045,    I took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the  gloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and  studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour
1046," There  were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the  library, so it was a good place to work"
1047," After that, if the night was  mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel,  and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station"
1048,"    I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night,  and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and  machines gives to the restless eye"
1049," I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue  and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few  minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever  know or disapprove"
1050," Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their  apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and  smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm  darkness"
1051," At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting  loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who  loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary  restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant  moments of night and life"
1052,"    Again at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined  five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I  felt a sinking in my heart"
1053," Forms leaned together in the taxis as they  waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes,  and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside"
1054," Imagining  that I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate  excitement, I wished them well"
1055,"    For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I  found her again"
1056," At first I was flattered to go places with her,  because she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name"
1057, Then it  was something more
1058," I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of  tender curiosity"
1059," The bored haughty face that she turned to the world  concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually,  even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found what it  was"
1060," When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a  borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about  it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me  that night at Daisy’s"
1061, At her first big golf tournament there was a  row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved  her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round
1062, The thing approached  the proportions of a scandal—then died away
1063," A caddy retracted his  statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been  mistaken"
1064, The incident and the name had remained together in my mind
1065,"    Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw  that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence  from a code would be thought impossible"
1066, She was incurably dishonest
1067,"  She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this  unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she  was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to  the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body"
1068,    It made no difference to me
1069," Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you  never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot"
1070, It was on  that same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving  a car
1071, It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our  fender flicked a button on one man’s coat
1072,"    “You’re a rotten driver,” I protested"
1073," “Either you ought to be more  careful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all"
1074,”    “I am careful
1075,"”    “No, you’re not"
1076,"”    “Well, other people are,” she said lightly"
1077,    “What’s that got to do with it
1078,"”    “They’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted"
1079, “It takes two to make an  accident
1080,”    “Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself
1081,"”    “I hope I never will,” she answered"
1082, “I hate careless people
1083, That’s  why I like you
1084,"”    Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had  deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved  her"
1085," But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as  brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself  definitely out of that tangle back home"
1086," I’d been writing letters once  a week and signing them: “Love, Nick,” and all I could think of was  how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache of  perspiration appeared on her upper lip"
1087, Nevertheless there was a vague  understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free
1088,"    Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and  this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever  known"
1089,"                                        IV    On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore,  the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled  hilariously on his lawn"
1090,"    “He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, moving somewhere between  his cocktails and his flowers"
1091, “One time he killed a man who had found  out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the  devil
1092," Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there  crystal glass"
1093,”    Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of  those who came to Gatsby’s house that summer
1094," It is an old timetable  now, disintegrating at its folds, and headed “This schedule in effect  July 5th, 1922"
1095,"” But I can still read the grey names, and they will  give you a better impression than my generalities of those who  accepted Gatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of  knowing nothing whatever about him"
1096,"    From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a  man named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who  was drowned last summer up in Maine"
1097," And the Hornbeams and the Willie  Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a  corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came  near"
1098, And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and  Mr
1099," Chrystie’s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned  cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all"
1100,"    Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember"
1101," He came only once,  in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the  garden"
1102, From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O
1103,  R
1104, P
1105," Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the  Fishguards and the Ripley Snells"
1106," Snell was there three days before he  went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that  Mrs"
1107, Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand
1108," The Dancies  came, too, and S"
1109, B
1110," Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice  A"
1111," Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and  Beluga’s girls"
1112,"    From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and  Cecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid, who  controlled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don  S"
1113," Schwartz (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the  movies in one way or another"
1114, And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G
1115,"  Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his  wife"
1116," Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B"
1117,"  (“Rot-Gut”) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came to  gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was  cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably  next day"
1118,    A man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as  “the boarder”—I doubt if he had any other home
1119, Of theatrical people  there were Gus Waize and Horace O’Donavan and Lester Myer and George  Duckweed and Francis Bull
1120, Also from New York were the Chromes and the  Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and  the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S
1121, W
1122," Belcher and the  Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L"
1123," Palmetto, who  killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square"
1124,    Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls
1125," They were never quite  the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with  another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before"
1126," I have  forgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria  or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names  of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American  capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves  to be"
1127,"    In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O’Brien came  there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had  his nose shot off in the war, and Mr"
1128," Albrucksburger and Miss Haag,  his fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr"
1129, P
1130," Jewett, once head of  the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be  her chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and  whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten"
1131,    All these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer
1132,"    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    At nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby’s gorgeous car  lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody  from its three-noted horn"
1133,"    It was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of  his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation,  made frequent use of his beach"
1134,"    “Good morning, old sport"
1135, You’re having lunch with me today and I  thought we’d ride up together
1136,"”    He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that  resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes,  I suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more,  with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games"
1137, This quality  was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape  of restlessness
1138, He was never quite still; there was always a tapping  foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand
1139,    He saw me looking with admiration at his car
1140,"    “It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport"
1141,” He jumped off to give me a better  view
1142, “Haven’t you ever seen it before
1143,”    I’d seen it
1144, Everybody had seen it
1145," It was a rich cream colour, bright  with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with  triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and toolboxes, and terraced with  a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns"
1146," Sitting down  behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory,  we started to town"
1147,"    I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and  found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say"
1148," So my first  impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had  gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an  elaborate roadhouse next door"
1149,    And then came that disconcerting ride
1150, We hadn’t reached West Egg  village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished  and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-coloured  suit
1151,"    “Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly, “what’s your  opinion of me, anyhow"
1152,"”    A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that  question deserves"
1153,"    “Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted"
1154,  “I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you  hear
1155,”    So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation  in his halls
1156,    “I’ll tell you God’s truth
1157,” His right hand suddenly ordered divine  retribution to stand by
1158, “I am the son of some wealthy people in the  Middle West—all dead now
1159," I was brought up in America but educated at  Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many  years"
1160, It is a family tradition
1161,”    He looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he  was lying
1162," He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed  it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before"
1163," And with  this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if  there wasn’t something a little sinister about him, after all"
1164,    “What part of the Middle West
1165,” I inquired casually
1166,    “San Francisco
1167,”    “I see
1168,”    “My family all died and I came into a good deal of money
1169,"”    His voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a  clan still haunted him"
1170," For a moment I suspected that he was pulling  my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise"
1171,"    “After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of  Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting  big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to  forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago"
1172,”    With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter
1173, The very  phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that  of a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued  a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne
1174,"    “Then came the war, old sport"
1175," It was a great relief, and I tried very  hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life"
1176, I accepted a  commission as first lieutenant when it began
1177, In the Argonne Forest I  took the remains of my machine-gun battalion so far forward that there  was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t  advance
1178," We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty  men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last  they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of  dead"
1179," I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave  me a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the  Adriatic Sea"
1180,”    Little Montenegro
1181, He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with his  smile
1182, The smile comprehended Montenegro’s troubled history and  sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people
1183, It  appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had  elicited this tribute from Montenegro’s warm little heart
1184, My  incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming  hastily through a dozen magazines
1185,"    He reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon,  fell into my palm"
1186,    “That’s the one from Montenegro
1187,"”    To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look"
1188," “Orderi di  Danilo,” ran the circular legend, “Montenegro, Nicolas Rex"
1189,”    “Turn it
1190,"”    “Major Jay Gatsby,” I read, “For Valour Extraordinary"
1191,”    “Here’s another thing I always carry
1192, A souvenir of Oxford days
1193, It  was taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of  Doncaster
1194,”    It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an  archway through which were visible a host of spires
1195," There was Gatsby,  looking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand"
1196,    Then it was all true
1197," I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace  on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with  their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart"
1198,"    “I’m going to make a big request of you today,” he said, pocketing his  souvenirs with satisfaction, “so I thought you ought to know something  about me"
1199, I didn’t want you to think I was just some nobody
1200," You see,  I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there  trying to forget the sad things that happened to me"
1201,” He hesitated
1202,  “You’ll hear about it this afternoon
1203,”    “At lunch
1204,"”    “No, this afternoon"
1205, I happened to find out that you’re taking Miss  Baker to tea
1206,”    “Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker
1207,"”    “No, old sport, I’m not"
1208, But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak  to you about this matter
1209,"”    I hadn’t the faintest idea what “this matter” was, but I was more  annoyed than interested"
1210, I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea in order to  discuss Mr
1211, Jay Gatsby
1212," I was sure the request would be something  utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I’d ever set foot upon  his overpopulated lawn"
1213,    He wouldn’t say another word
1214, His correctness grew on him as we neared  the city
1215," We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of  red-belted oceangoing ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with  the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds"
1216,"  Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a  glimpse of Mrs"
1217, Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting  vitality as we went by
1218,"    With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half  Astoria—only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated  I heard the familiar “jug-jug-spat"
1219,"” of a motorcycle, and a frantic  policeman rode alongside"
1220,"    “All right, old sport,” called Gatsby"
1221, We slowed down
1222," Taking a white  card from his wallet, he waved it before the man’s eyes"
1223,"    “Right you are,” agreed the policeman, tipping his cap"
1224," “Know you next  time, Mr"
1225, Gatsby
1226, Excuse me
1227,”    “What was that
1228,” I inquired
1229, “The picture of Oxford
1230,"”    “I was able to do the commissioner a favour once, and he sends me a  Christmas card every year"
1231,"”    Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a  constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across  the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of  nonolfactory money"
1232," The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always  the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the  mystery and the beauty in the world"
1233,"    A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two  carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for  friends"
1234," The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short  upper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of  Gatsby’s splendid car was included in their sombre holiday"
1235," As we  crossed Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white  chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl"
1236, I  laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in  haughty rivalry
1237,"    “Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought;  “anything at all …”    Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder"
1238,    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    Roaring noon
1239, In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby  for lunch
1240," Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes  picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man"
1241,    “Mr
1242," Carraway, this is my friend Mr"
1243, Wolfshiem
1244,"”    A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two  fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril"
1245, After a  moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness
1246,"    “—So I took one look at him,” said Mr"
1247," Wolfshiem, shaking my hand  earnestly, “and what do you think I did"
1248,”    “What
1249,” I inquired politely
1250,"    But evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and  covered Gatsby with his expressive nose"
1251,"    “I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: ‘All right, Katspaugh,  don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth"
1252,’ He shut it then and  there
1253,"”    Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the  restaurant, whereupon Mr"
1254, Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was  starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction
1255,    “Highballs
1256,” asked the head waiter
1257,"    “This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr"
1258," Wolfshiem, looking at the  presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling"
1259, “But I like across the street  better
1260,"”    “Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr"
1261, Wolfshiem: “It’s too  hot over there
1262,"”    “Hot and small—yes,” said Mr"
1263," Wolfshiem, “but full of memories"
1264,”    “What place is that
1265,” I asked
1266,    “The old Metropole
1267,"”    “The old Metropole,” brooded Mr"
1268, Wolfshiem gloomily
1269, “Filled with  faces dead and gone
1270, Filled with friends gone now forever
1271, I can’t  forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there
1272," It  was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all  evening"
1273, When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a  funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside
1274," ‘All  right,’ says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his  chair"
1275,"    “ ‘Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don’t  you, so help me, move outside this room"
1276,"’    “It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised the  blinds we’d of seen daylight"
1277,”    “Did he go
1278,” I asked innocently
1279,    “Sure he went
1280,” Mr
1281, Wolfshiem’s nose flashed at me indignantly
1282, “He  turned around in the door and says: ‘Don’t let that waiter take away  my coffee
1283,"’ Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three  times in his full belly and drove away"
1284,"”    “Four of them were electrocuted,” I said, remembering"
1285,"    “Five, with Becker"
1286,” His nostrils turned to me in an interested way
1287,  “I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion
1288,”    The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling
1289," Gatsby answered  for me:    “Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t the man"
1290,”    “No
1291,” Mr
1292, Wolfshiem seemed disappointed
1293,    “This is just a friend
1294, I told you we’d talk about that some other  time
1295,"”    “I beg your pardon,” said Mr"
1296," Wolfshiem, “I had a wrong man"
1297,"”    A succulent hash arrived, and Mr"
1298," Wolfshiem, forgetting the more  sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with  ferocious delicacy"
1299," His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around  the room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people  directly behind"
1300," I think that, except for my presence, he would have  taken one short glance beneath our own table"
1301,"    “Look here, old sport,” said Gatsby, leaning toward me, “I’m afraid I  made you a little angry this morning in the car"
1302,"”    There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it"
1303,"    “I don’t like mysteries,” I answered, “and I don’t understand why you  won’t come out frankly and tell me what you want"
1304, Why has it all got  to come through Miss Baker
1305,"”    “Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured me"
1306," “Miss Baker’s a great  sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all  right"
1307,"”    Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room,  leaving me with Mr"
1308, Wolfshiem at the table
1309,"    “He has to telephone,” said Mr"
1310," Wolfshiem, following him with his  eyes"
1311," “Fine fellow, isn’t he"
1312, Handsome to look at and a perfect  gentleman
1313,”    “Yes
1314,”    “He’s an Oggsford man
1315,”    “Oh
1316,”    “He went to Oggsford College in England
1317, You know Oggsford College
1318,”    “I’ve heard of it
1319,”    “It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world
1320,”    “Have you known Gatsby for a long time
1321,” I inquired
1322,"    “Several years,” he answered in a gratified way"
1323, “I made the pleasure  of his acquaintance just after the war
1324, But I knew I had discovered a  man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour
1325, I said to  myself: ‘There’s the kind of man you’d like to take home and introduce  to your mother and sister
1326,’ ” He paused
1327, “I see you’re looking at my  cuff buttons
1328,"”    I hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now"
1329, They were composed of  oddly familiar pieces of ivory
1330,"    “Finest specimens of human molars,” he informed me"
1331,    “Well
1332,” I inspected them
1333, “That’s a very interesting idea
1334,”    “Yeah
1335,” He flipped his sleeves up under his coat
1336," “Yeah, Gatsby’s very  careful about women"
1337, He would never so much as look at a friend’s  wife
1338,”    When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and  sat down Mr
1339, Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his  feet
1340,"    “I have enjoyed my lunch,” he said, “and I’m going to run off from you  two young men before I outstay my welcome"
1341,"”    “Don’t hurry Meyer,” said Gatsby, without enthusiasm"
1342, Mr
1343, Wolfshiem  raised his hand in a sort of benediction
1344,"    “You’re very polite, but I belong to another generation,” he announced  solemnly"
1345, “You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies  and your—” He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his  hand
1346," “As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won’t impose myself on  you any longer"
1347,”    As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling
1348, I  wondered if I had said anything to offend him
1349,"    “He becomes very sentimental sometimes,” explained Gatsby"
1350, “This is  one of his sentimental days
1351, He’s quite a character around New York—a  denizen of Broadway
1352,"”    “Who is he, anyhow, an actor"
1353,”    “No
1354,”    “A dentist
1355,”    “Meyer Wolfshiem
1356," No, he’s a gambler"
1357,"” Gatsby hesitated, then added,  coolly: “He’s the man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919"
1358,”    “Fixed the World’s Series
1359,” I repeated
1360,    The idea staggered me
1361," I remembered, of course, that the World’s  Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I  would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of  some inevitable chain"
1362, It never occurred to me that one man could  start to play with the faith of fifty million people—with the  single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe
1363,    “How did he happen to do that
1364,” I asked after a minute
1365,    “He just saw the opportunity
1366,”    “Why isn’t he in jail
1367,"”    “They can’t get him, old sport"
1368, He’s a smart man
1369,”    I insisted on paying the check
1370, As the waiter brought my change I  caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room
1371,"    “Come along with me for a minute,” I said; “I’ve got to say hello to  someone"
1372,”    When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our  direction
1373,    “Where’ve you been
1374,” he demanded eagerly
1375, “Daisy’s furious because you  haven’t called up
1376,”    “This is Mr
1377," Gatsby, Mr"
1378, Buchanan
1379,"”    They shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of  embarrassment came over Gatsby’s face"
1380,"    “How’ve you been, anyhow"
1381,” demanded Tom of me
1382, “How’d you happen to  come up this far to eat
1383,”    “I’ve been having lunch with Mr
1384, Gatsby
1385,”    I turned toward Mr
1386," Gatsby, but he was no longer there"
1387,"    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    One October day in nineteen-seventeen—    (said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a  straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)    —I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks  and half on the lawns"
1388, I was happier on the lawns because I had on  shoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the  soft ground
1389," I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the  wind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in  front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut,  in a disapproving way"
1390,    The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to  Daisy Fay’s house
1391," She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and  by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville"
1392," She  dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long  the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp  Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that  night"
1393," “Anyways, for an hour"
1394,"”    When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was  beside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had  never seen before"
1395, They were so engrossed in each other that she  didn’t see me until I was five feet away
1396,"    “Hello, Jordan,” she called unexpectedly"
1397, “Please come here
1398,"”    I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the  older girls I admired her most"
1399, She asked me if I was going to the Red  Cross to make bandages
1400, I was
1401," Well, then, would I tell them that she  couldn’t come that day"
1402," The officer looked at Daisy while she was  speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at  sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the  incident ever since"
1403," His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn’t lay eyes on  him again for over four years—even after I’d met him on Long Island I  didn’t realize it was the same man"
1404,    That was nineteen-seventeen
1405," By the next year I had a few beaux  myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very  often"
1406, She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone  at all
1407, Wild rumours were circulating about her—how her mother had  found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say  goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas
1408," She was effectually  prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family for  several weeks"
1409," After that she didn’t play around with the soldiers any  more, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town,  who couldn’t get into the army at all"
1410,"    By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever"
1411," She had a début  after the armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a  man from New Orleans"
1412," In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago,  with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before"
1413," He  came down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a  whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he  gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand  dollars"
1414,    I was a bridesmaid
1415," I came into her room half an hour before the  bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June  night in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey"
1416, She had a bottle  of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other
1417,"    “ ’Gratulate me,” she muttered"
1418," “Never had a drink before, but oh how  I do enjoy it"
1419,"”    “What’s the matter, Daisy"
1420,"”    I was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that before"
1421,"    “Here, dearies"
1422,” She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her  on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls
1423, “Take ’em downstairs  and give ’em back to whoever they belong to
1424, Tell ’em all Daisy’s  change’ her mine
1425, Say: ‘Daisy’s change’ her mine
1426,’ ”    She began to cry—she cried and cried
1427," I rushed out and found her  mother’s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath"
1428,  She wouldn’t let go of the letter
1429," She took it into the tub with her  and squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the  soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow"
1430,    But she didn’t say another word
1431," We gave her spirits of ammonia and  put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half  an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around  her neck and the incident was over"
1432," Next day at five o’clock she  married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a  three months’ trip to the South Seas"
1433,"    I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I’d  never seen a girl so mad about her husband"
1434," If he left the room for a  minute she’d look around uneasily, and say: “Where’s Tom gone"
1435,” and  wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the  door
1436," She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the  hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with  unfathomable delight"
1437," It was touching to see them together—it made you  laugh in a hushed, fascinated way"
1438, That was in August
1439," A week after I  left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night,  and ripped a front wheel off his car"
1440," The girl who was with him got  into the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the  chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel"
1441,"    The next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for  a year"
1442," I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and  then they came back to Chicago to settle down"
1443," Daisy was popular in  Chicago, as you know"
1444," They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young  and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect  reputation"
1445, Perhaps because she doesn’t drink
1446, It’s a great advantage  not to drink among hard-drinking people
1447," You can hold your tongue and,  moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that  everybody else is so blind that they don’t see or care"
1448," Perhaps Daisy  never went in for amour at all—and yet there’s something in that voice  of hers …    Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first  time in years"
1449, It was when I asked you—do you remember
1450,—if you knew  Gatsby in West Egg
1451," After you had gone home she came into my room and  woke me up, and said: “What Gatsby"
1452,” and when I described him—I was  half asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man  she used to know
1453, It wasn’t until then that I connected this Gatsby  with the officer in her white car
1454,    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza  for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park
1455,"  The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in  the West Fifties, and the clear voices of children, already gathered  like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:     “I’m the Sheik of Araby"
1456, Your love belongs to me
1457," At night when   you’re asleep Into your tent I’ll creep—”    “It was a strange coincidence,” I said"
1458,    “But it wasn’t a coincidence at all
1459,”    “Why not
1460,”    “Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay
1461,”    Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that  June night
1462," He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of  his purposeless splendour"
1463,"    “He wants to know,” continued Jordan, “if you’ll invite Daisy to your  house some afternoon and then let him come over"
1464,”    The modesty of the demand shook me
1465, He had waited five years and  bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths—so that  he could “come over” some afternoon to a stranger’s garden
1466,    “Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing
1467,"”    “He’s afraid, he’s waited so long"
1468, He thought you might be  offended
1469," You see, he’s regular tough underneath it all"
1470,”    Something worried me
1471,    “Why didn’t he ask you to arrange a meeting
1472,"”    “He wants her to see his house,” she explained"
1473, “And your house is  right next door
1474,”    “Oh
1475,"”    “I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some  night,” went on Jordan, “but she never did"
1476," Then he began asking  people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found"
1477," It  was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard  the elaborate way he worked up to it"
1478," Of course, I immediately  suggested a luncheon in New York—and I thought he’d go mad:    “ ‘I don’t want to do anything out of the way"
1479,’ he kept saying
1480, ‘I  want to see her right next door
1481,"’    “When I said you were a particular friend of Tom’s, he started to  abandon the whole idea"
1482," He doesn’t know very much about Tom, though he  says he’s read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of  catching a glimpse of Daisy’s name"
1483,"”    It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm  around Jordan’s golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her  to dinner"
1484," Suddenly I wasn’t thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more,  but of this clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in universal  scepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my  arm"
1485," A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady  excitement: “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and  the tired"
1486,"”    “And Daisy ought to have something in her life,” murmured Jordan to  me"
1487,    “Does she want to see Gatsby
1488,”    “She’s not to know about it
1489, Gatsby doesn’t want her to know
1490, You’re  just supposed to invite her to tea
1491,"”    We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the façade of Fifty-Ninth  Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park"
1492,"  Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied face  floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs, and so I drew up  the girl beside me, tightening my arms"
1493," Her wan, scornful mouth  smiled, and so I drew her up again closer, this time to my face"
1494,                                        V    When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that  my house was on fire
1495," Two o’clock and the whole corner of the  peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery  and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires"
1496," Turning a  corner, I saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar"
1497,"    At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved  itself into “hide-and-go-seek” or “sardines-in-the-box” with all the  house thrown open to the game"
1498, But there wasn’t a sound
1499," Only wind in  the trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on  again as if the house had winked into the darkness"
1500, As my taxi groaned  away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn
1501,"    “Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said"
1502,    “Does it
1503,” He turned his eyes toward it absently
1504, “I have been  glancing into some of the rooms
1505," Let’s go to Coney Island, old  sport"
1506, In my car
1507,”    “It’s too late
1508,"”    “Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool"
1509, I haven’t made  use of it all summer
1510,”    “I’ve got to go to bed
1511,”    “All right
1512,"”    He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness"
1513,"    “I talked with Miss Baker,” I said after a moment"
1514, “I’m going to call  up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea
1515,"”    “Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly"
1516, “I don’t want to put you  to any trouble
1517,”    “What day would suit you
1518,”    “What day would suit you
1519,” he corrected me quickly
1520," “I don’t want to  put you to any trouble, you see"
1521,”    “How about the day after tomorrow
1522,”    He considered for a moment
1523," Then, with reluctance: “I want to get the  grass cut,” he said"
1524,"    We both looked down at the grass—there was a sharp line where my  ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began"
1525, I  suspected that he meant my grass
1526,"    “There’s another little thing,” he said uncertainly, and hesitated"
1527,    “Would you rather put it off for a few days
1528,” I asked
1529,"    “Oh, it isn’t about that"
1530, At least—” He fumbled with a series of  beginnings
1531," “Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don’t make  much money, do you"
1532,”    “Not very much
1533,”    This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently
1534,"    “I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you see, I carry on a  little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand"
1535," And  I thought that if you don’t make very much—You’re selling bonds,  aren’t you, old sport"
1536,”    “Trying to
1537,"”    “Well, this would interest you"
1538, It wouldn’t take up much of your time  and you might pick up a nice bit of money
1539, It happens to be a rather  confidential sort of thing
1540,”    I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation  might have been one of the crises of my life
1541," But, because the offer  was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no  choice except to cut him off there"
1542,"    “I’ve got my hands full,” I said"
1543, “I’m much obliged but I couldn’t  take on any more work
1544,”    “You wouldn’t have to do any business with Wolfshiem
1545,"” Evidently he  thought that I was shying away from the “gonnegtion” mentioned at  lunch, but I assured him he was wrong"
1546," He waited a moment longer,  hoping I’d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be  responsive, so he went unwillingly home"
1547,    The evening had made me lightheaded and happy; I think I walked into a  deep sleep as I entered my front door
1548," So I don’t know whether or not  Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he “glanced into  rooms” while his house blazed gaudily on"
1549," I called up Daisy from the  office next morning, and invited her to come to tea"
1550,"    “Don’t bring Tom,” I warned her"
1551,    “What
1552,”    “Don’t bring Tom
1553,”    “Who is ‘Tom’
1554,” she asked innocently
1555,    The day agreed upon was pouring rain
1556," At eleven o’clock a man in a  raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that  Mr"
1557, Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass
1558," This reminded me that I  had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg  Village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy  some cups and lemons and flowers"
1559,"    The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived  from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it"
1560," An hour  later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel  suit, silver shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in"
1561," He was pale,  and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes"
1562,    “Is everything all right
1563,” he asked immediately
1564,"    “The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean"
1565,”    “What grass
1566,” he inquired blankly
1567," “Oh, the grass in the yard"
1568,"” He  looked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don’t  believe he saw a thing"
1569,"    “Looks very good,” he remarked vaguely"
1570, “One of the papers said they  thought the rain would stop about four
1571, I think it was The  Journal
1572, Have you got everything you need in the shape of—of tea
1573,"”    I took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at  the Finn"
1574, Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the  delicatessen shop
1575,    “Will they do
1576,” I asked
1577,"    “Of course, of course"
1578, They’re fine
1579,"” and he added hollowly, “… old  sport"
1580,"”    The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which  occasional thin drops swam like dew"
1581," Gatsby looked with vacant eyes  through a copy of Clay’s Economics, starting at the Finnish tread that  shook the kitchen floor, and peering towards the bleared windows from  time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were  taking place outside"
1582," Finally he got up and informed me, in an  uncertain voice, that he was going home"
1583,    “Why’s that
1584,”    “Nobody’s coming to tea
1585, It’s too late
1586,” He looked at his watch as if  there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere
1587, “I can’t wait  all day
1588,”    “Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four
1589,"”    He sat down miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously  there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane"
1590," We both jumped  up, and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard"
1591,    Under the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open car was coming up the  drive
1592, It stopped
1593," Daisy’s face, tipped sideways beneath a  three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic  smile"
1594,"    “Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one"
1595,”    The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain
1596," I  had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear  alone, before any words came through"
1597," A damp streak of hair lay like a  dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with  glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car"
1598,"    “Are you in love with me,” she said low in my ear, “or why did I have  to come alone"
1599,”    “That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent
1600, Tell your chauffeur to go far  away and spend an hour
1601,"”    “Come back in an hour, Ferdie"
1602,” Then in a grave murmur: “His name is  Ferdie
1603,”    “Does the gasoline affect his nose
1604,"”    “I don’t think so,” she said innocently"
1605, “Why
1606,”    We went in
1607, To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted
1608,"    “Well, that’s funny,” I exclaimed"
1609,    “What’s funny
1610,”    She turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the  front door
1611, I went out and opened it
1612," Gatsby, pale as death, with his  hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a  puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes"
1613,"    With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the  hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into the  living-room"
1614, It wasn’t a bit funny
1615, Aware of the loud beating of my  own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain
1616,    For half a minute there wasn’t a sound
1617," Then from the living-room I  heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by  Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note:    “I certainly am awfully glad to see you again"
1618,”    A pause; it endured horribly
1619," I had nothing to do in the hall, so I  went into the room"
1620,"    Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the  mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of  boredom"
1621," His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face  of a defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position his distraught  eyes stared down at Daisy, who was sitting, frightened but graceful,  on the edge of a stiff chair"
1622,"    “We’ve met before,” muttered Gatsby"
1623," His eyes glanced momentarily at  me, and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh"
1624," Luckily  the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his  head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers, and  set it back in place"
1625," Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm  of the sofa and his chin in his hand"
1626,"    “I’m sorry about the clock,” he said"
1627,    My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn
1628, I couldn’t muster up  a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head
1629,"    “It’s an old clock,” I told them idiotically"
1630,    I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on  the floor
1631,"    “We haven’t met for many years,” said Daisy, her voice as  matter-of-fact as it could ever be"
1632,    “Five years next November
1633,”    The automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us all back at least  another minute
1634, I had them both on their feet with the desperate  suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac  Finn brought it in on a tray
1635,    Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical  decency established itself
1636," Gatsby got himself into a shadow and,  while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other  of us with tense, unhappy eyes"
1637," However, as calmness wasn’t an end in  itself, I made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got to my  feet"
1638,    “Where are you going
1639,” demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm
1640,    “I’ll be back
1641,”    “I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go
1642,"”    He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and  whispered: “Oh, God"
1643,” in a miserable way
1644,    “What’s the matter
1645,"”    “This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his head from side to  side, “a terrible, terrible mistake"
1646,"”    “You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,” and luckily I added: “Daisy’s  embarrassed too"
1647,”    “She’s embarrassed
1648,” he repeated incredulously
1649,    “Just as much as you are
1650,”    “Don’t talk so loud
1651,"”    “You’re acting like a little boy,” I broke out impatiently"
1652," “Not only  that, but you’re rude"
1653, Daisy’s sitting in there all alone
1654,"”    He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable  reproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the other  room"
1655,"    I walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made his  nervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a huge  black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the  rain"
1656," Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by  Gatsby’s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric  marshes"
1657," There was nothing to look at from under the tree except  Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church  steeple, for half an hour"
1658," A brewer had built it early in the “period”  craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he’d agreed to pay  five years’ taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would  have their roofs thatched with straw"
1659, Perhaps their refusal took the  heart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate  decline
1660, His children sold his house with the black wreath still on  the door
1661," Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have  always been obstinate about being peasantry"
1662,"    After half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer’s automobile  rounded Gatsby’s drive with the raw material for his servants’  dinner—I felt sure he wouldn’t eat a spoonful"
1663," A maid began opening  the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and,  leaning from the large central bay, spat meditatively into the  garden"
1664, It was time I went back
1665," While the rain continued it had  seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little  now and then with gusts of emotion"
1666, But in the new silence I felt that  silence had fallen within the house too
1667,"    I went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of  pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they heard a sound"
1668," They  were sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if  some question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of  embarrassment was gone"
1669," Daisy’s face was smeared with tears, and when  I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief  before a mirror"
1670, But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply  confounding
1671, He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of  exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little  room
1672,"    “Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if he hadn’t seen me for years"
1673, I  thought for a moment he was going to shake hands
1674,    “It’s stopped raining
1675,”    “Has it
1676,"” When he realized what I was talking about, that there were  twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man,  like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to  Daisy"
1677, “What do you think of that
1678, It’s stopped raining
1679,"”    “I’m glad, Jay"
1680,"” Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told  only of her unexpected joy"
1681,"    “I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,” he said, “I’d like to  show her around"
1682,”    “You’re sure you want me to come
1683,"”    “Absolutely, old sport"
1684,”    Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought with  humiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn
1685,"    “My house looks well, doesn’t it"
1686,” he demanded
1687, “See how the whole  front of it catches the light
1688,”    I agreed that it was splendid
1689,    “Yes
1690,"” His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower"
1691, “It  took me just three years to earn the money that bought it
1692,”    “I thought you inherited your money
1693,"”    “I did, old sport,” he said automatically, “but I lost most of it in  the big panic—the panic of the war"
1694,"”    I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what  business he was in he answered: “That’s my affair,” before he realized  that it wasn’t an appropriate reply"
1695,"    “Oh, I’ve been in several things,” he corrected himself"
1696, “I was in the  drug business and then I was in the oil business
1697, But I’m not in  either one now
1698,” He looked at me with more attention
1699, “Do you mean  you’ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night
1700,"”    Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of  brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight"
1701,    “That huge place there
1702,” she cried pointing
1703,    “Do you like it
1704,"”    “I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone"
1705,"”    “I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day"
1706, People  who do interesting things
1707, Celebrated people
1708,”    Instead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the  road and entered by the big postern
1709," With enchanting murmurs Daisy  admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky,  admired the gardens, the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy  odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of  kiss-me-at-the-gate"
1710," It was strange to reach the marble steps and find  no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but  bird voices in the trees"
1711,"    And inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and  Restoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind  every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we  had passed through"
1712, As Gatsby closed the door of “the Merton College  Library” I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into  ghostly laughter
1713,"    We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender  silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms,  and bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a  dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor"
1714, It  was Mr
1715," Klipspringer, the “boarder"
1716,” I had seen him wandering hungrily  about the beach that morning
1717," Finally we came to Gatsby’s own  apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam’s study, where we sat  down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in  the wall"
1718,"    He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued  everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew  from her well-loved eyes"
1719," Sometimes too, he stared around at his  possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding  presence none of it was any longer real"
1720, Once he nearly toppled down a  flight of stairs
1721,    His bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was  garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold
1722," Daisy took the brush  with delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and  shaded his eyes and began to laugh"
1723,"    “It’s the funniest thing, old sport,” he said hilariously"
1724, “I  can’t—When I try to—”    He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a  third
1725, After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed  with wonder at her presence
1726," He had been full of the idea so long,  dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to  speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity"
1727," Now, in the reaction,  he was running down like an over-wound clock"
1728,"    Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent  cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and  his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high"
1729,    “I’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes
1730," He sends over a  selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall"
1731,"”    He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one,  before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel,  which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in  many-coloured disarray"
1732," While we admired he brought more and the soft  rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in  coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of  indian blue"
1733," Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into  the shirts and began to cry stormily"
1734,"    “They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the  thick folds"
1735, “It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such  beautiful shirts before
1736,"”    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and  the hydroplane, and the midsummer flowers—but outside Gatsby’s window  it began to rain again, so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated  surface of the Sound"
1737,"    “If it wasn’t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,”  said Gatsby"
1738, “You always have a green light that burns all night at  the end of your dock
1739,"”    Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what  he had just said"
1740, Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal  significance of that light had now vanished forever
1741," Compared to the  great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very  near to her, almost touching her"
1742, It had seemed as close as a star to  the moon
1743, Now it was again a green light on a dock
1744, His count of  enchanted objects had diminished by one
1745,"    I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects  in the half darkness"
1746," A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting  costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk"
1747,    “Who’s this
1748,”    “That
1749, That’s Mr
1750," Dan Cody, old sport"
1751,”    The name sounded faintly familiar
1752,    “He’s dead now
1753, He used to be my best friend years ago
1754,"”    There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the  bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently  when he was about eighteen"
1755,"    “I adore it,” exclaimed Daisy"
1756, “The pompadour
1757, You never told me you  had a pompadour—or a yacht
1758,"”    “Look at this,” said Gatsby quickly"
1759, “Here’s a lot of clippings—about  you
1760,”    They stood side by side examining it
1761," I was going to ask to see the  rubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver"
1762,"    “Yes … Well, I can’t talk now … I can’t talk now, old sport … I said a  small town … He must know what a small town is … Well, he’s no use to  us if Detroit is his idea of a small town …”    He rang off"
1763,    “Come here quick
1764,” cried Daisy at the window
1765,"    The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west,  and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea"
1766,"    “Look at that,” she whispered, and then after a moment: “I’d like to  just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you  around"
1767,"”    I tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps my presence  made them feel more satisfactorily alone"
1768,"    “I know what we’ll do,” said Gatsby, “we’ll have Klipspringer play the  piano"
1769,”    He went out of the room calling “Ewing
1770,"” and returned in a few minutes  accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with  shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair"
1771," He was now decently  clothed in a “sport shirt,” open at the neck, sneakers, and duck  trousers of a nebulous hue"
1772,    “Did we interrupt your exercise
1773,” inquired Daisy politely
1774,"    “I was asleep,” cried Mr"
1775," Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment"
1776,"  “That is, I’d been asleep"
1777," Then I got up …”    “Klipspringer plays the piano,” said Gatsby, cutting him off"
1778," “Don’t  you, Ewing, old sport"
1779,”    “I don’t play well
1780, I don’t—hardly play at all
1781," I’m all out of prac—”    “We’ll go downstairs,” interrupted Gatsby"
1782, He flipped a switch
1783, The  grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light
1784,    In the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano
1785,"  He lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her  on a couch far across the room, where there was no light save what the  gleaming floor bounced in from the hall"
1786,    When Klipspringer had played “The Love Nest” he turned around on the  bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom
1787,"    “I’m all out of practice, you see"
1788, I told you I couldn’t play
1789," I’m all  out of prac—”    “Don’t talk so much, old sport,” commanded Gatsby"
1790, “Play
1791,"”     “In the morning, In the evening, Ain’t we got fun—”    Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along  the Sound"
1792," All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric  trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New  York"
1793," It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was  generating on the air"
1794,     “One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer The rich get richer and the   poor get—children
1795," In the meantime, In between time—”    As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of  bewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubt  had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness"
1796, Almost  five years
1797," There must have been moments even that afternoon when  Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault, but  because of the colossal vitality of his illusion"
1798," It had gone beyond  her, beyond everything"
1799," He had thrown himself into it with a creative  passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright  feather that drifted his way"
1800, No amount of fire or freshness can  challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart
1801,"    As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly"
1802," His hand took  hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned  toward her with a rush of emotion"
1803," I think that voice held him most,  with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn’t be  over-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song"
1804,"    They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand;  Gatsby didn’t know me now at all"
1805," I looked once more at them and they  looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life"
1806," Then I went  out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them  there together"
1807,                                        VI    About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one  morning at Gatsby’s door and asked him if he had anything to say
1808,    “Anything to say about what
1809,” inquired Gatsby politely
1810,    “Why—any statement to give out
1811,”    It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard  Gatsby’s name around his office in a connection which he either  wouldn’t reveal or didn’t fully understand
1812, This was his day off and  with laudable initiative he had hurried out “to see
1813,"”    It was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s instinct was right"
1814,"  Gatsby’s notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his  hospitality and so become authorities upon his past, had increased all  summer until he fell just short of being news"
1815," Contemporary legends  such as the “underground pipeline to Canada” attached themselves to  him, and there was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a house  at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly  up and down the Long Island shore"
1816," Just why these inventions were a  source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn’t easy to  say"
1817,"    James Gatz—that was really, or at least legally, his name"
1818, He had  changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that  witnessed the beginning of his career—when he saw Dan Cody’s yacht  drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior
1819," It was  James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a  torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay  Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the Tuolomee, and  informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an  hour"
1820,"    I suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time, even then"
1821, His  parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people—his imagination  had never really accepted them as his parents at all
1822," The truth was  that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic  conception of himself"
1823," He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it means  anything, means just that—and he must be about His Father’s business,  the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty"
1824," So he invented  just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be  likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end"
1825,    For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of  Lake Superior as a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher or in any other  capacity that brought him food and bed
1826," His brown, hardening body  lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing  days"
1827," He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became  contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of  the others because they were hysterical about things which in his  overwhelming self-absorption he took for granted"
1828,"    But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot"
1829, The most grotesque  and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night
1830, A universe of  ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock  ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled  clothes upon the floor
1831, Each night he added to the pattern of his  fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an  oblivious embrace
1832," For a while these reveries provided an outlet for  his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of  reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on  a fairy’s wing"
1833,"    An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before,  to the small Lutheran College of St"
1834, Olaf’s in southern Minnesota
1835," He  stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the  drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor’s  work with which he was to pay his way through"
1836," Then he drifted back to  Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the  day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore"
1837,"    Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields,  of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five"
1838," The  transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire  found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and,  suspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him  from his money"
1839," The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye,  the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and  sent him to sea in a yacht, were common property of the turgid  journalism in 1902"
1840, He had been coasting along all too hospitable  shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny in  Little Girl Bay
1841,"    To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck,  that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world"
1842, I  suppose he smiled at Cody—he had probably discovered that people liked  him when he smiled
1843, At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of  them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick and  extravagantly ambitious
1844," A few days later he took him to Duluth and  bought him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and a  yachting cap"
1845," And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the  Barbary Coast, Gatsby left too"
1846,"    He was employed in a vague personal capacity—while he remained with  Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even  jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk  might soon be about, and he provided for such contingencies by  reposing more and more trust in Gatsby"
1847," The arrangement lasted five  years, during which the boat went three times around the Continent"
1848,  It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye  came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody  inhospitably died
1849,"    I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby’s bedroom, a grey, florid  man with a hard, empty face—the pioneer debauchee, who during one  phase of American life brought back to the Eastern seaboard the savage  violence of the frontier brothel and saloon"
1850, It was indirectly due to  Cody that Gatsby drank so little
1851, Sometimes in the course of gay  parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he  formed the habit of letting liquor alone
1852,    And it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy of twenty-five  thousand dollars
1853, He didn’t get it
1854," He never understood the legal  device that was used against him, but what remained of the millions  went intact to Ella Kaye"
1855, He was left with his singularly appropriate  education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the  substantiality of a man
1856,"    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    He told me all this very much later, but I’ve put it down here with  the idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents,  which weren’t even faintly true"
1857," Moreover he told it to me at a time  of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and  nothing about him"
1858," So I take advantage of this short halt, while  Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of  misconceptions away"
1859,"    It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs"
1860," For several  weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly I was in  New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself  with her senile aunt—but finally I went over to his house one Sunday  afternoon"
1861, I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom  Buchanan in for a drink
1862," I was startled, naturally, but the really  surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened before"
1863,"    They were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and  a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously"
1864,"    “I’m delighted to see you,” said Gatsby, standing on his porch"
1865, “I’m  delighted that you dropped in
1866,”    As though they cared
1867,    “Sit right down
1868, Have a cigarette or a cigar
1869,"” He walked around the  room quickly, ringing bells"
1870, “I’ll have something to drink for you in  just a minute
1871,”    He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there
1872," But he  would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in  a vague way that that was all they came for"
1873, Mr
1874, Sloane wanted  nothing
1875, A lemonade
1876," No, thanks"
1877, A little champagne
1878," Nothing at all,  thanks … I’m sorry—    “Did you have a nice ride"
1879,”    “Very good roads around here
1880,”    “I suppose the automobiles—”    “Yeah
1881,"”    Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had  accepted the introduction as a stranger"
1882,"    “I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr"
1883, Buchanan
1884,"”    “Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering"
1885,  “So we did
1886, I remember very well
1887,”    “About two weeks ago
1888,”    “That’s right
1889, You were with Nick here
1890,"”    “I know your wife,” continued Gatsby, almost aggressively"
1891,    “That so
1892,”    Tom turned to me
1893,"    “You live near here, Nick"
1894,”    “Next door
1895,”    “That so
1896,”    Mr
1897," Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation, but lounged back  haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either—until  unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial"
1898,"    “We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr"
1899," Gatsby,” she suggested"
1900,  “What do you say
1901,”    “Certainly; I’d be delighted to have you
1902,"”    “Be ver’ nice,” said Mr"
1903," Sloane, without gratitude"
1904, “Well—think ought  to be starting home
1905,"”    “Please don’t hurry,” Gatsby urged them"
1906," He had control of himself  now, and he wanted to see more of Tom"
1907, “Why don’t you—why don’t you  stay for supper
1908, I wouldn’t be surprised if some other people dropped  in from New York
1909,"”    “You come to supper with me,” said the lady enthusiastically"
1910, “Both of  you
1911,”    This included me
1912, Mr
1913, Sloane got to his feet
1914,"    “Come along,” he said—but to her only"
1915,"    “I mean it,” she insisted"
1916, “I’d love to have you
1917, Lots of room
1918,”    Gatsby looked at me questioningly
1919, He wanted to go and he didn’t see  that Mr
1920, Sloane had determined he shouldn’t
1921,"    “I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said"
1922,"    “Well, you come,” she urged, concentrating on Gatsby"
1923,    Mr
1924, Sloane murmured something close to her ear
1925,"    “We won’t be late if we start now,” she insisted aloud"
1926,"    “I haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby"
1927," “I used to ride in the army, but  I’ve never bought a horse"
1928, I’ll have to follow you in my car
1929, Excuse  me for just a minute
1930,"”    The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady  began an impassioned conversation aside"
1931,"    “My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom"
1932, “Doesn’t he know she  doesn’t want him
1933,”    “She says she does want him
1934,”    “She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there
1935,” He  frowned
1936, “I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy
1937," By God, I may be  old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to  suit me"
1938, They meet all kinds of crazy fish
1939,”    Suddenly Mr
1940, Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted  their horses
1941,"    “Come on,” said Mr"
1942," Sloane to Tom, “we’re late"
1943, We’ve got to go
1944,"”  And  then to me: “Tell him we couldn’t wait, will you"
1945,"”    Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they  trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage  just as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the  front door"
1946,"    Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on  the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s  party"
1947, Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of  oppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other parties  that summer
1948," There were the same people, or at least the same sort of  people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured,  many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a  pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before"
1949," Or perhaps I had  merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete  in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to  nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was  looking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes"
1950, It is invariably saddening  to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your  own powers of adjustment
1951,"    They arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling  hundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat"
1952,"    “These things excite me so,” she whispered"
1953," “If you want to kiss me  any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll be glad  to arrange it for you"
1954, Just mention my name
1955, Or present a green card
1956,"  I’m giving out green—”    “Look around,” suggested Gatsby"
1957,    “I’m looking around
1958, I’m having a marvellous—”    “You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard about
1959,”    Tom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd
1960,"    “We don’t go around very much,” he said; “in fact, I was just thinking  I don’t know a soul here"
1961,”    “Perhaps you know that lady
1962,"” Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely  human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree"
1963," Tom  and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies  the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies"
1964,"    “She’s lovely,” said Daisy"
1965,    “The man bending over her is her director
1966,”    He took them ceremoniously from group to group:    “Mrs
1967, Buchanan … and Mr
1968, Buchanan—” After an instant’s hesitation he  added: “the polo player
1969,"”    “Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not me"
1970,”    But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained “the  polo player” for the rest of the evening
1971,"    “I’ve never met so many celebrities,” Daisy exclaimed"
1972, “I liked that  man—what was his name
1973,—with the sort of blue nose
1974,"”    Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer"
1975,"    “Well, I liked him anyhow"
1976,"”    “I’d a little rather not be the polo player,” said Tom pleasantly,  “I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion"
1977,”    Daisy and Gatsby danced
1978," I remember being surprised by his graceful,  conservative foxtrot—I had never seen him dance before"
1979," Then they  sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour,  while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden"
1980," “In case  there’s a fire or a flood,” she explained, “or any act of God"
1981,”    Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper  together
1982, “Do you mind if I eat with some people over here
1983,” he  said
1984, “A fellow’s getting off some funny stuff
1985,"”    “Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “and if you want to take down any  addresses here’s my little gold pencil"
1986,"” … She looked around after a  moment and told me the girl was “common but pretty,” and I knew that  except for the half-hour she’d been alone with Gatsby she wasn’t  having a good time"
1987,    We were at a particularly tipsy table
1988," That was my fault—Gatsby had  been called to the phone, and I’d enjoyed these same people only two  weeks before"
1989, But what had amused me then turned septic on the air  now
1990,"    “How do you feel, Miss Baedeker"
1991,"”    The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my  shoulder"
1992, At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes
1993,    “Wha’
1994,"”    A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf  with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:    “Oh, she’s all right now"
1995, When she’s had five or six cocktails she  always starts screaming like that
1996, I tell her she ought to leave it  alone
1997,"”    “I do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused hollowly"
1998,"    “We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebody  that needs your help, Doc"
1999,"’ ”    “She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another friend, without  gratitude, “but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in  the pool"
2000,"”    “Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,” mumbled Miss  Baedeker"
2001, “They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey
2002,"”    “Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered Doctor Civet"
2003,    “Speak for yourself
2004,” cried Miss Baedeker violently
2005, “Your hand  shakes
2006, I wouldn’t let you operate on me
2007,”    It was like that
2008, Almost the last thing I remember was standing with  Daisy and watching the moving-picture director and his Star
2009," They were  still under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except  for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between"
2010," It occurred to me that he  had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this  proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate  degree and kiss at her cheek"
2011,"    “I like her,” said Daisy, “I think she’s lovely"
2012,”    But the rest offended her—and inarguably because it wasn’t a gesture  but an emotion
2013," She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented  “place” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing  village—appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old  euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants  along a shortcut from nothing to nothing"
2014, She saw something awful in  the very simplicity she failed to understand
2015,    I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car
2016,  It was dark here in front; only the bright door sent ten square feet  of light volleying out into the soft black morning
2017," Sometimes a shadow  moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow,  an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an  invisible glass"
2018,    “Who is this Gatsby anyhow
2019,” demanded Tom suddenly
2020, “Some big  bootlegger
2021,”    “Where’d you hear that
2022,” I inquired
2023,    “I didn’t hear it
2024, I imagined it
2025," A lot of these newly rich people are  just big bootleggers, you know"
2026,"”    “Not Gatsby,” I said shortly"
2027,    He was silent for a moment
2028, The pebbles of the drive crunched under  his feet
2029,"    “Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie  together"
2030,”    A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy’s fur collar
2031,"    “At least they are more interesting than the people we know,” she said  with an effort"
2032,    “You didn’t look so interested
2033,"”    “Well, I was"
2034,”    Tom laughed and turned to me
2035,    “Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her under  a cold shower
2036,"”    Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper,  bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and  would never have again"
2037," When the melody rose her voice broke up  sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change  tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air"
2038,"    “Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,” she said  suddenly"
2039, “That girl hadn’t been invited
2040, They simply force their way  in and he’s too polite to object
2041,"”    “I’d like to know who he is and what he does,” insisted Tom"
2042, “And I  think I’ll make a point of finding out
2043,"”    “I can tell you right now,” she answered"
2044," “He owned some drugstores, a  lot of drugstores"
2045, He built them up himself
2046,”    The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive
2047,"    “Good night, Nick,” said Daisy"
2048,"    Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where  “Three O’Clock in the Morning,” a neat, sad little waltz of that year,  was drifting out the open door"
2049," After all, in the very casualness of  Gatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from  her world"
2050, What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling  her back inside
2051," What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours"
2052,"  Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare  and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with  one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would  blot out those five years of unwavering devotion"
2053,    I stayed late that night
2054," Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free,  and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had  run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights  were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead"
2055," When he came down the  steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face,  and his eyes were bright and tired"
2056,"    “She didn’t like it,” he said immediately"
2057,    “Of course she did
2058,"”    “She didn’t like it,” he insisted"
2059, “She didn’t have a good time
2060,"”    He was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression"
2061,"    “I feel far away from her,” he said"
2062, “It’s hard to make her  understand
2063,”    “You mean about the dance
2064,”    “The dance
2065,” He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of  his fingers
2066," “Old sport, the dance is unimportant"
2067,”    He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and  say: “I never loved you
2068,” After she had obliterated four years with  that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be  taken
2069," One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back  to Louisville and be married from her house—just as if it were five  years ago"
2070,"    “And she doesn’t understand,” he said"
2071, “She used to be able to  understand
2072, We’d sit for hours—”    He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit  rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers
2073,"    “I wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I ventured"
2074, “You can’t repeat the  past
2075,”    “Can’t repeat the past
2076,” he cried incredulously
2077, “Why of course you  can
2078,"”    He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the  shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand"
2079,"    “I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,” he said,  nodding determinedly"
2080, “She’ll see
2081,"”    He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to  recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into  loving Daisy"
2082," His life had been confused and disordered since then,  but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it  all slowly, he could find out what that thing was …    … One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the  street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where  there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight"
2083, They  stopped here and turned toward each other
2084, Now it was a cool night  with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes  of the year
2085, The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the  darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars
2086," Out of the  corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really  formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he could  climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the  pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder"
2087,    His heart beat faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own
2088," He  knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable  visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like  the mind of God"
2089," So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the  tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star"
2090, Then he kissed her
2091, At  his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the  incarnation was complete
2092,"    Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was  reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words,  that I had heard somewhere a long time ago"
2093," For a moment a phrase  tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s,  as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled  air"
2094," But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was  uncommunicable forever"
2095,"                                       VII    It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights  in his house failed to go on one Saturday night—and, as obscurely as  it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over"
2096, Only gradually did I  become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his  drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away
2097, Wondering  if he were sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with a  villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door
2098,    “Is Mr
2099, Gatsby sick
2100,”    “Nope
2101,"” After a pause he added “sir” in a dilatory, grudging way"
2102,"    “I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried"
2103, Tell him Mr
2104,  Carraway came over
2105,”    “Who
2106,” he demanded rudely
2107,    “Carraway
2108,”    “Carraway
2109," All right, I’ll tell him"
2110,”    Abruptly he slammed the door
2111,"    My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his  house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never  went into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered  moderate supplies over the telephone"
2112," The grocery boy reported that  the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the  village was that the new people weren’t servants at all"
2113,    Next day Gatsby called me on the phone
2114,    “Going away
2115,” I inquired
2116,"    “No, old sport"
2117,”    “I hear you fired all your servants
2118,”    “I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip
2119, Daisy comes over quite  often—in the afternoons
2120,”    So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the  disapproval in her eyes
2121,    “They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for
2122, They’re all  brothers and sisters
2123, They used to run a small hotel
2124,”    “I see
2125,”    He was calling up at Daisy’s request—would I come to lunch at her  house tomorrow
2126, Miss Baker would be there
2127, Half an hour later Daisy  herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was  coming
2128, Something was up
2129, And yet I couldn’t believe that they would  choose this occasion for a scene—especially for the rather harrowing  scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden
2130,"    The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of  the summer"
2131," As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only  the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering  hush at noon"
2132," The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of  combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into  her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her  fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry"
2133, Her  pocketbook slapped to the floor
2134,"    “Oh, my"
2135,” she gasped
2136,"    I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it  at arm’s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that  I had no designs upon it—but everyone near by, including the woman,  suspected me just the same"
2137,    “Hot
2138,” said the conductor to familiar faces
2139, “Some weather
2140, … Hot
2141, …  Hot
2142, … Hot
2143, … Is it hot enough for you
2144, Is it hot
2145, Is it … 
2146,”    My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand
2147,"  That anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed,  whose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart"
2148,"    … Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint wind, carrying  the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at  the door"
2149,    “The master’s body
2150,” roared the butler into the mouthpiece
2151," “I’m  sorry, madame, but we can’t furnish it—it’s far too hot to touch this  noon"
2152,”    What he really said was: “Yes … Yes … I’ll see
2153,"”    He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to  take our stiff straw hats"
2154,    “Madame expects you in the salon
2155,"” he cried, needlessly indicating the  direction"
2156, In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the  common store of life
2157,"    The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool"
2158," Daisy and  Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down  their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans"
2159,"    “We can’t move,” they said together"
2160,"    Jordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment  in mine"
2161,    “And Mr
2162," Thomas Buchanan, the athlete"
2163,” I inquired
2164,"    Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall  telephone"
2165,    Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with  fascinated eyes
2166," Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting  laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air"
2167,"    “The rumour is,” whispered Jordan, “that that’s Tom’s girl on the  telephone"
2168,”    We were silent
2169," The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: “Very  well, then, I won’t sell you the car at all … I’m under no obligations  to you at all … and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I  won’t stand that at all"
2170,"”    “Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy cynically"
2171,"    “No, he’s not,” I assured her"
2172, “It’s a bona-fide deal
2173, I happen to  know about it
2174,"”    Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his  thick body, and hurried into the room"
2175,    “Mr
2176, Gatsby
2177,"” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed  dislike"
2178," “I’m glad to see you, sir … Nick …”    “Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy"
2179,"    As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and  pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth"
2180,"    “You know I love you,” she murmured"
2181,"    “You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan"
2182,    Daisy looked around doubtfully
2183,    “You kiss Nick too
2184,"”    “What a low, vulgar girl"
2185,”    “I don’t care
2186,"” cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace"
2187,  Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just  as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room
2188,"    “Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding out her arms"
2189, “Come to your  own mother that loves you
2190,"”    The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and  rooted shyly into her mother’s dress"
2191,    “The bles-sed pre-cious
2192, Did mother get powder on your old yellowy  hair
2193," Stand up now, and say—How-de-do"
2194,”    Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand
2195,  Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise
2196, I don’t think he  had ever really believed in its existence before
2197,"    “I got dressed before luncheon,” said the child, turning eagerly to  Daisy"
2198,    “That’s because your mother wanted to show you off
2199,” Her face bent  into the single wrinkle of the small white neck
2200," “You dream, you"
2201, You  absolute little dream
2202,"”    “Yes,” admitted the child calmly"
2203, “Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dress  too
2204,”    “How do you like mother’s friends
2205,” Daisy turned her around so that  she faced Gatsby
2206, “Do you think they’re pretty
2207,”    “Where’s Daddy
2208,"”    “She doesn’t look like her father,” explained Daisy"
2209, “She looks like  me
2210, She’s got my hair and shape of the face
2211,”    Daisy sat back upon the couch
2212, The nurse took a step forward and held  out her hand
2213,"    “Come, Pammy"
2214,"”    “Goodbye, sweetheart"
2215,"”    With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to  her nurse’s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back,  preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice"
2216,    Gatsby took up his drink
2217,"    “They certainly look cool,” he said, with visible tension"
2218,"    We drank in long, greedy swallows"
2219,"    “I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter every year,” said Tom  genially"
2220, “It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall into  the sun—or wait a minute—it’s just the opposite—the sun’s getting  colder every year
2221,"    “Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby, “I’d like you to have a look  at the place"
2222,”    I went with them out to the veranda
2223," On the green Sound, stagnant in  the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea"
2224,  Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed  across the bay
2225,    “I’m right across from you
2226,”    “So you are
2227,”    Our eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy  refuse of the dog-days alongshore
2228, Slowly the white wings of the boat  moved against the blue cool limit of the sky
2229, Ahead lay the scalloped  ocean and the abounding blessed isles
2230,"    “There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding"
2231, “I’d like to be out there  with him for about an hour
2232,"”    We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and  drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale"
2233,    “What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon
2234,"” cried Daisy, “and the  day after that, and the next thirty years"
2235,"”    “Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said"
2236, “Life starts all over again when it  gets crisp in the fall
2237,"”    “But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, “and  everything’s so confused"
2238, Let’s all go to town
2239,"”    Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding  its senselessness into forms"
2240,"    “I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to  Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a  garage"
2241,”    “Who wants to go to town
2242,” demanded Daisy insistently
2243, Gatsby’s eyes  floated toward her
2244," “Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool"
2245,"”    Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in  space"
2246, With an effort she glanced down at the table
2247,"    “You always look so cool,” she repeated"
2248,"    She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw"
2249, He was  astounded
2250," His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and  then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew  a long time ago"
2251,"    “You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently"
2252,"  “You know the advertisement of the man—”    “All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to  town"
2253, Come on—we’re all going to town
2254,"”    He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife"
2255, No one  moved
2256,    “Come on
2257,” His temper cracked a little
2258," “What’s the matter, anyhow"
2259,"  If we’re going to town, let’s start"
2260,"”    His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips  the last of his glass of ale"
2261, Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out  on to the blazing gravel drive
2262,    “Are we just going to go
2263,” she objected
2264, “Like this
2265, Aren’t we going  to let anyone smoke a cigarette first
2266,”    “Everybody smoked all through lunch
2267,"”    “Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him"
2268, “It’s too hot to fuss
2269,”    He didn’t answer
2270,"    “Have it your own way,” she said"
2271," “Come on, Jordan"
2272,”    They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there  shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet
2273, A silver curve of the moon  hovered already in the western sky
2274," Gatsby started to speak, changed  his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly"
2275,    “Have you got your stables here
2276,” asked Gatsby with an effort
2277,    “About a quarter of a mile down the road
2278,”    “Oh
2279,”    A pause
2280,"    “I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely"
2281,  “Women get these notions in their heads—”    “Shall we take anything to drink
2282,” called Daisy from an upper window
2283,"    “I’ll get some whisky,” answered Tom"
2284, He went inside
2285,"    Gatsby turned to me rigidly:    “I can’t say anything in his house, old sport"
2286,"”    “She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked"
2287, “It’s full of—” I  hesitated
2288,"    “Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly"
2289,    That was it
2290, I’d never understood before
2291," It was full of money—that  was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of  it, the cymbals’ song of it … High in a white palace the king’s  daughter, the golden girl …    Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed  by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and  carrying light capes over their arms"
2292,    “Shall we all go in my car
2293,” suggested Gatsby
2294," He felt the hot, green  leather of the seat"
2295, “I ought to have left it in the shade
2296,”    “Is it standard shift
2297,” demanded Tom
2298,    “Yes
2299,"”    “Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town"
2300,”    The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby
2301,"    “I don’t think there’s much gas,” he objected"
2302,"    “Plenty of gas,” said Tom boisterously"
2303, He looked at the gauge
2304, “And  if it runs out I can stop at a drugstore
2305, You can buy anything at a  drugstore nowadays
2306,”    A pause followed this apparently pointless remark
2307," Daisy looked at Tom  frowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar  and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in  words, passed over Gatsby’s face"
2308,"    “Come on, Daisy” said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby’s  car"
2309, “I’ll take you in this circus wagon
2310,"”    He opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm"
2311,    “You take Nick and Jordan
2312, We’ll follow you in the coupé
2313,"”    She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand"
2314," Jordan  and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby’s car, Tom pushed the  unfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive  heat, leaving them out of sight behind"
2315,    “Did you see that
2316,” demanded Tom
2317,    “See what
2318,"”    He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known  all along"
2319,"    “You think I’m pretty dumb, don’t you"
2320,” he suggested
2321," “Perhaps I am,  but I have a—almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to  do"
2322," Maybe you don’t believe that, but science—”    He paused"
2323," The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back  from the edge of theoretical abyss"
2324,"    “I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow,” he continued"
2325, “I  could have gone deeper if I’d known—”    “Do you mean you’ve been to a medium
2326,” inquired Jordan humorously
2327,    “What
2328,"” Confused, he stared at us as we laughed"
2329, “A medium
2330,”    “About Gatsby
2331,”    “About Gatsby
2332," No, I haven’t"
2333, I said I’d been making a small  investigation of his past
2334,"”    “And you found he was an Oxford man,” said Jordan helpfully"
2335,    “An Oxford man
2336,” He was incredulous
2337, “Like hell he is
2338, He wears a pink  suit
2339,”    “Nevertheless he’s an Oxford man
2340,"”    “Oxford, New Mexico,” snorted Tom contemptuously, “or something like  that"
2341,"”    “Listen, Tom"
2342," If you’re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch"
2343,”  demanded Jordan crossly
2344,    “Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married—God knows  where
2345,"”    We were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we  drove for a while in silence"
2346, Then as Doctor T
2347, J
2348," Eckleburg’s faded  eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby’s caution  about gasoline"
2349,"    “We’ve got enough to get us to town,” said Tom"
2350,"    “But there’s a garage right here,” objected Jordan"
2351, “I don’t want to  get stalled in this baking heat
2352,"”    Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dusty  stop under Wilson’s sign"
2353, After a moment the proprietor emerged from  the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car
2354,    “Let’s have some gas
2355,” cried Tom roughly
2356, “What do you think we  stopped for—to admire the view
2357,"”    “I’m sick,” said Wilson without moving"
2358, “Been sick all day
2359,”    “What’s the matter
2360,”    “I’m all run down
2361,"”    “Well, shall I help myself"
2362,” Tom demanded
2363, “You sounded well enough on  the phone
2364,"”    With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and,  breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank"
2365, In the sunlight his  face was green
2366,"    “I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said"
2367," “But I need money  pretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your  old car"
2368,”    “How do you like this one
2369,” inquired Tom
2370, “I bought it last week
2371,"”    “It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson, as he strained at the handle"
2372,    “Like to buy it
2373,"”    “Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly"
2374," “No, but I could make some money  on the other"
2375,"”    “What do you want money for, all of a sudden"
2376,”    “I’ve been here too long
2377, I want to get away
2378, My wife and I want to go  West
2379,"”    “Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled"
2380,    “She’s been talking about it for ten years
2381,"” He rested for a moment  against the pump, shading his eyes"
2382, “And now she’s going whether she  wants to or not
2383, I’m going to get her away
2384,”    The coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a  waving hand
2385,    “What do I owe you
2386,” demanded Tom harshly
2387,"    “I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,” remarked  Wilson"
2388, “That’s why I want to get away
2389, That’s why I been bothering  you about the car
2390,”    “What do I owe you
2391,”    “Dollar twenty
2392,”    The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a  bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn’t  alighted on Tom
2393," He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life  apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically  sick"
2394," I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel  discovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there  was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as  the difference between the sick and the well"
2395," Wilson was so sick that  he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor  girl with child"
2396,"    “I’ll let you have that car,” said Tom"
2397, “I’ll send it over tomorrow  afternoon
2398,"”    That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare  of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of  something behind"
2399, Over the ash-heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T
2400, J
2401,"  Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that  other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than  twenty feet away"
2402,"    In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved  aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car"
2403," So  engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and  one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a  slowly developing picture"
2404," Her expression was curiously familiar—it  was an expression I had often seen on women’s faces, but on Myrtle  Wilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized  that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on  Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife"
2405,"    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we  drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic"
2406," His wife and his  mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping  precipitately from his control"
2407," Instinct made him step on the  accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving  Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an  hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in  sight of the easygoing blue coupé"
2408,"    “Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,” suggested  Jordan"
2409, “I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone’s away
2410,"  There’s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of  funny fruits were going to fall into your hands"
2411,"”    The word “sensuous” had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but  before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop, and Daisy  signalled us to draw up alongside"
2412,    “Where are we going
2413,” she cried
2414,    “How about the movies
2415,"”    “It’s so hot,” she complained"
2416, “You go
2417, We’ll ride around and meet you  after
2418,” With an effort her wit rose faintly
2419, “We’ll meet you on some  corner
2420, I’ll be the man smoking two cigarettes
2421,"”    “We can’t argue about it here,” Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave  out a cursing whistle behind us"
2422," “You follow me to the south side of  Central Park, in front of the Plaza"
2423,"”    Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if  the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight"
2424, I  think he was afraid they would dart down a side-street and out of his  life forever
2425,    But they didn’t
2426, And we all took the less explicable step of engaging  the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel
2427,"    The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into  that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in  the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around  my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back"
2428,"  The notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five  bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as  “a place to have a mint julep"
2429,"” Each of us said over and over that it  was a “crazy idea”—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and  thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny …    The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four  o’clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery  from the Park"
2430," Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us,  fixing her hair"
2431,"    “It’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan respectfully, and everyone  laughed"
2432,"    “Open another window,” commanded Daisy, without turning around"
2433,    “There aren’t any more
2434,"”    “Well, we’d better telephone for an axe—”    “The thing to do is to forget about the heat,” said Tom impatiently"
2435,  “You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it
2436,”    He unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the  table
2437,"    “Why not let her alone, old sport"
2438,” remarked Gatsby
2439, “You’re the one  that wanted to come to town
2440,”    There was a moment of silence
2441," The telephone book slipped from its  nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse  me”—but this time no one laughed"
2442,"    “I’ll pick it up,” I offered"
2443,    “I’ve got it
2444,"” Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered “Hum"
2445,"” in  an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair"
2446,"    “That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it"
2447,” said Tom sharply
2448,    “What is
2449,”    “All this ‘old sport’ business
2450, Where’d you pick that up
2451,"”    “Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, “if  you’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute"
2452,  Call up and order some ice for the mint julep
2453,”    As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound  and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s  Wedding March from the ballroom below
2454,    “Imagine marrying anybody in this heat
2455,” cried Jordan dismally
2456,"    “Still—I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered"
2457,  “Louisville in June
2458, Somebody fainted
2459," Who was it fainted, Tom"
2460,"”    “Biloxi,” he answered shortly"
2461,    “A man named Biloxi
2462," ‘Blocks’ Biloxi, and he made boxes—that’s a  fact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee"
2463,"”    “They carried him into my house,” appended Jordan, “because we lived  just two doors from the church"
2464," And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy  told him he had to get out"
2465, The day after he left Daddy died
2466,”  After  a moment she added
2467, “There wasn’t any connection
2468,"”    “I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,” I remarked"
2469,    “That was his cousin
2470, I knew his whole family history before he  left
2471, He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today
2472,"”    The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer  floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of  “Yea—ea—ea"
2473,” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began
2474,"    “We’re getting old,” said Daisy"
2475, “If we were young we’d rise and  dance
2476,"”    “Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned her"
2477," “Where’d you know him, Tom"
2478,”    “Biloxi
2479,” He concentrated with an effort
2480, “I didn’t know him
2481, He was a  friend of Daisy’s
2482,"”    “He was not,” she denied"
2483, “I’d never seen him before
2484, He came down in  the private car
2485,"”    “Well, he said he knew you"
2486, He said he was raised in Louisville
2487, Asa  Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room  for him
2488,”    Jordan smiled
2489,    “He was probably bumming his way home
2490, He told me he was president of  your class at Yale
2491,”    Tom and I looked at each other blankly
2492,    “Biloxi
2493,"”    “First place, we didn’t have any president—”    Gatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly"
2494,"    “By the way, Mr"
2495," Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man"
2496,”    “Not exactly
2497,"”    “Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford"
2498,”    “Yes—I went there
2499,”    A pause
2500," Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting:    “You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven"
2501,”    Another pause
2502, A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice  but the silence was unbroken by his “thank you” and the soft closing  of the door
2503, This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last
2504,"    “I told you I went there,” said Gatsby"
2505,"    “I heard you, but I’d like to know when"
2506,"”    “It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months"
2507, That’s why I  can’t really call myself an Oxford man
2508,”    Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief
2509, But we were all  looking at Gatsby
2510,"    “It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the  armistice,” he continued"
2511, “We could go to any of the universities in  England or France
2512,”    I wanted to get up and slap him on the back
2513, I had one of those  renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before
2514,"    Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table"
2515,"    “Open the whisky, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep"
2516,  Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself … Look at the mint
2517,"”    “Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want to ask Mr"
2518, Gatsby one more  question
2519,"”    “Go on,” Gatsby said politely"
2520,    “What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow
2521,”    They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content
2522,"    “He isn’t causing a row,” Daisy looked desperately from one to the  other"
2523, “You’re causing a row
2524, Please have a little self-control
2525,”    “Self-control
2526,” repeated Tom incredulously
2527, “I suppose the latest  thing is to sit back and let Mr
2528, Nobody from Nowhere make love to your  wife
2529," Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out … Nowadays people  begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next  they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between  black and white"
2530,"”    Flushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone  on the last barrier of civilization"
2531,"    “We’re all white here,” murmured Jordan"
2532,    “I know I’m not very popular
2533, I don’t give big parties
2534, I suppose  you’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any  friends—in the modern world
2535,"”    Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he  opened his mouth"
2536, The transition from libertine to prig was so  complete
2537,"    “I’ve got something to tell you, old sport—” began Gatsby"
2538, But Daisy  guessed at his intention
2539,    “Please don’t
2540,” she interrupted helplessly
2541, “Please let’s all go  home
2542, Why don’t we all go home
2543,"”    “That’s a good idea,” I got up"
2544," “Come on, Tom"
2545, Nobody wants a drink
2546,”    “I want to know what Mr
2547, Gatsby has to tell me
2548,"”    “Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby"
2549, “She’s never loved you
2550,  She loves me
2551,”    “You must be crazy
2552,” exclaimed Tom automatically
2553,"    Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement"
2554,"    “She never loved you, do you hear"
2555,” he cried
2556, “She only married you  because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me
2557," It was a  terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me"
2558,"”    At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted  with competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had  anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously  of their emotions"
2559,"    “Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal  note"
2560, “What’s been going on
2561, I want to hear all about it
2562,"”    “I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby"
2563, “Going on for five  years—and you didn’t know
2564,”    Tom turned to Daisy sharply
2565,    “You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years
2566,"”    “Not seeing,” said Gatsby"
2567," “No, we couldn’t meet"
2568," But both of us loved  each other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know"
2569, I used to  laugh sometimes”—but there was no laughter in his eyes—“to think that  you didn’t know
2570,”    “Oh—that’s all
2571,” Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a  clergyman and leaned back in his chair
2572,    “You’re crazy
2573,” he exploded
2574," “I can’t speak about what happened five  years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then—and I’ll be damned if I  see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries  to the back door"
2575, But all the rest of that’s a God damned lie
2576, Daisy  loved me when she married me and she loves me now
2577,"”    “No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head"
2578,"    “She does, though"
2579, The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish  ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing
2580,” He nodded  sagely
2581," “And what’s more, I love Daisy too"
2582," Once in a while I go off  on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in  my heart I love her all the time"
2583,"”    “You’re revolting,” said Daisy"
2584," She turned to me, and her voice,  dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do  you know why we left Chicago"
2585, I’m surprised that they didn’t treat you  to the story of that little spree
2586,”    Gatsby walked over and stood beside her
2587,"    “Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly"
2588, “It doesn’t matter  any more
2589, Just tell him the truth—that you never loved him—and it’s  all wiped out forever
2590,”    She looked at him blindly
2591, “Why—how could I love him—possibly
2592,”    “You never loved him
2593,”    She hesitated
2594," Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal,  as though she realized at last what she was doing—and as though she  had never, all along, intended doing anything at all"
2595, But it was done  now
2596, It was too late
2597,"    “I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance"
2598,    “Not at Kapiolani
2599,” demanded Tom suddenly
2600,    “No
2601,"”    From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were  drifting up on hot waves of air"
2602,    “Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your  shoes dry
2603,” There was a husky tenderness in his tone … “Daisy
2604,”    “Please don’t
2605,"” Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it"
2606,  She looked at Gatsby
2607," “There, Jay,” she said—but her hand as she tried  to light a cigarette was trembling"
2608, Suddenly she threw the cigarette  and the burning match on the carpet
2609,"    “Oh, you want too much"
2610,” she cried to Gatsby
2611, “I love you now—isn’t  that enough
2612, I can’t help what’s past
2613,” She began to sob  helplessly
2614, “I did love him once—but I loved you too
2615,”    Gatsby’s eyes opened and closed
2616,    “You loved me too
2617,” he repeated
2618,"    “Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely"
2619, “She didn’t know you were  alive
2620," Why—there’s things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know,  things that neither of us can ever forget"
2621,”    The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby
2622,"    “I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted"
2623," “She’s all excited  now—”    “Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful  voice"
2624, “It wouldn’t be true
2625,"”    “Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom"
2626,    She turned to her husband
2627,"    “As if it mattered to you,” she said"
2628,    “Of course it matters
2629, I’m going to take better care of you from now  on
2630,"”    “You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a touch of panic"
2631, “You’re  not going to take care of her any more
2632,”    “I’m not
2633,” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed
2634, He could afford to  control himself now
2635, “Why’s that
2636,”    “Daisy’s leaving you
2637,”    “Nonsense
2638,"”    “I am, though,” she said with a visible effort"
2639,    “She’s not leaving me
2640,” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby
2641,  “Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he  put on her finger
2642,”    “I won’t stand this
2643,” cried Daisy
2644," “Oh, please let’s get out"
2645,"”    “Who are you, anyhow"
2646,” broke out Tom
2647, “You’re one of that bunch that  hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know
2648, I’ve  made a little investigation into your affairs—and I’ll carry it  further tomorrow
2649,"”    “You can suit yourself about that, old sport,” said Gatsby steadily"
2650,    “I found out what your ‘drugstores’ were
2651,” He turned to us and spoke  rapidly
2652, “He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street  drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the  counter
2653, That’s one of his little stunts
2654," I picked him for a  bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn’t far wrong"
2655,”    “What about it
2656,” said Gatsby politely
2657, “I guess your friend Walter  Chase wasn’t too proud to come in on it
2658,"”    “And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you"
2659, You let him go to jail for  a month over in New Jersey
2660, God
2661, You ought to hear Walter on the  subject of you
2662,”    “He came to us dead broke
2663," He was very glad to pick up some money, old  sport"
2664,”    “Don’t you call me ‘old sport’
2665,” cried Tom
2666, Gatsby said  nothing
2667," “Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but  Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth"
2668,”    That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s face
2669,"    “That drugstore business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly,  “but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell me  about"
2670,"”    I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her  husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but  absorbing object on the tip of her chin"
2671, Then I turned back to  Gatsby—and was startled at his expression
2672, He looked—and this is said  in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had  “killed a man
2673,” For a moment the set of his face could be described in  just that fantastic way
2674,"    It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying  everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been  made"
2675," But with every word she was drawing further and further into  herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the  afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible,  struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across  the room"
2676,    The voice begged again to go
2677,"    “Please, Tom"
2678, I can’t stand this any more
2679,"”    Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage  she had had, were definitely gone"
2680,"    “You two start on home, Daisy,” said Tom"
2681, “In Mr
2682, Gatsby’s car
2683,"”    She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous  scorn"
2684,    “Go on
2685, He won’t annoy you
2686, I think he realizes that his presumptuous  little flirtation is over
2687,"”    They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental,  isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity"
2688,    After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of  whisky in the towel
2689,    “Want any of this stuff
2690, Jordan
2691, … Nick
2692,”    I didn’t answer
2693,    “Nick
2694,” He asked again
2695,    “What
2696,”    “Want any
2697,”    “No … I just remembered that today’s my birthday
2698,”    I was thirty
2699," Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a  new decade"
2700,    It was seven o’clock when we got into the coupé with him and started  for Long Island
2701," Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but  his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on  the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead"
2702," Human sympathy  has its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments  fade with the city lights behind"
2703," Thirty—the promise of a decade of  loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning  briefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair"
2704," But there was Jordan beside  me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten  dreams from age to age"
2705, As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face  fell lazily against my coat’s shoulder and the formidable stroke of  thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand
2706,    So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight
2707,"    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the  ash-heaps was the principal witness at the inquest"
2708," He had slept  through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the  garage, and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale  as his own pale hair and shaking all over"
2709," Michaelis advised him to go  to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if  he did"
2710, While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent  racket broke out overhead
2711,"    “I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly"
2712,"  “She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we’re  going to move away"
2713,"”    Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and  Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement"
2714,"  Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he  sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars  that passed along the road"
2715," When anyone spoke to him he invariably  laughed in an agreeable, colourless way"
2716, He was his wife’s man and not  his own
2717,"    So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson  wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious  glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain  times on certain days"
2718," Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some  workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis  took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later"
2719, But he  didn’t
2720," He supposed he forgot to, that’s all"
2721," When he came outside  again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation  because he heard Mrs"
2722," Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in  the garage"
2723,    “Beat me
2724,” he heard her cry
2725," “Throw me down and beat me, you dirty  little coward"
2726,"”    A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and  shouting—before he could move from his door the business was over"
2727,"    The “death car” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out  of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then  disappeared around the next bend"
2728, Mavro Michaelis wasn’t even sure of  its colour—he told the first policeman that it was light green
2729," The  other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards  beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life  violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark  blood with the dust"
2730,"    Michaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open  her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left  breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen  for the heart beneath"
2731," The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at  the corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the  tremendous vitality she had stored so long"
2732,    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still  some distance away
2733,    “Wreck
2734,” said Tom
2735, “That’s good
2736, Wilson’ll have a little business at  last
2737,"”    He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as  we came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage  door made him automatically put on the brakes"
2738,"    “We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look"
2739,"”    I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly  from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked  toward the door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God"
2740,” uttered  over and over in a gasping moan
2741,"    “There’s some bad trouble here,” said Tom excitedly"
2742,"    He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the  garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal  basket overhead"
2743," Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a  violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way  through"
2744,    The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it  was a minute before I could see anything at all
2745," Then new arrivals  deranged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside"
2746,"    Myrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another  blanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on  a worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending  over it, motionless"
2747, Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking  down names with much sweat and correction in a little book
2748," At first I  couldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed  clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the  raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to  the doorposts with both hands"
2749," Some man was talking to him in a low  voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his  shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw"
2750," His eyes would drop slowly  from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk  back to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high,  horrible call:    “Oh, my Ga-od"
2751," Oh, my Ga-od"
2752," Oh, Ga-od"
2753," Oh, my Ga-od"
2754,"”    Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around  the garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to  the policeman"
2755,"    “M-a-v—” the policeman was saying, “—o—”    “No, r—” corrected the man, “M-a-v-r-o—”    “Listen to me"
2756,” muttered Tom fiercely
2757,"    “r—” said the policeman, “o—”    “g—”    “g—” He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder"
2758,"  “What you want, fella"
2759,”    “What happened
2760,—that’s what I want to know
2761,”    “Auto hit her
2762, Ins’antly killed
2763,"”    “Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring"
2764,    “She ran out ina road
2765, Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus car
2766,"”    “There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one comin’, one goin’, see"
2767,”    “Going where
2768,” asked the policeman keenly
2769,    “One goin’ each way
2770," Well, she”—his hand rose toward the blankets but  stopped halfway and fell to his side—“she ran out there an’ the one  comin’ from N’York knock right into her, goin’ thirty or forty miles  an hour"
2771,”    “What’s the name of this place here
2772,” demanded the officer
2773,    “Hasn’t got any name
2774,”    A pale well-dressed negro stepped near
2775,"    “It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car"
2776, New
2777,”    “See the accident
2778,” asked the policeman
2779,"    “No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n forty"
2780," Going  fifty, sixty"
2781,”    “Come here and let’s have your name
2782, Look out now
2783, I want to get his  name
2784,"”    Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in  the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his  grasping cries:    “You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was"
2785, I know what kind  of car it was
2786,"”    Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten  under his coat"
2787," He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in  front of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms"
2788,"    “You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said with soothing  gruffness"
2789,    Wilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then  would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright
2790,"    “Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little"
2791," “I just got here a minute  ago, from New York"
2792, I was bringing you that coupé we’ve been talking  about
2793, That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine—do you  hear
2794, I haven’t seen it all afternoon
2795,"”    Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the  policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent  eyes"
2796,    “What’s all that
2797,” he demanded
2798,    “I’m a friend of his
2799,” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on  Wilson’s body
2800, “He says he knows the car that did it … It was a yellow  car
2801,”    Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom
2802,    “And what colour’s your car
2803,"”    “It’s a blue car, a coupé"
2804,"”    “We’ve come straight from New York,” I said"
2805,"    Someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and  the policeman turned away"
2806,"    “Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct—”    Picking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set  him down in a chair, and came back"
2807,"    “If somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he snapped  authoritatively"
2808, He watched while the two men standing closest glanced  at each other and went unwillingly into the room
2809," Then Tom shut the  door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the  table"
2810, As he passed close to me he whispered: “Let’s get out
2811,"”    Self-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we  pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,  case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago"
2812,"    Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down  hard, and the coupé raced along through the night"
2813," In a little while I  heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down  his face"
2814,    “The God damned coward
2815,” he whimpered
2816, “He didn’t even stop his car
2817,”    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark  rustling trees
2818," Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the  second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines"
2819,"    “Daisy’s home,” he said"
2820, As we got out of the car he glanced at me and  frowned slightly
2821,"    “I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick"
2822, There’s nothing we can  do tonight
2823,"”    A change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision"
2824,  As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of  the situation in a few brisk phrases
2825,"    “I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting  you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some  supper—if you want any"
2826,” He opened the door
2827, “Come in
2828,"”    “No, thanks"
2829, But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi
2830, I’ll wait  outside
2831,”    Jordan put her hand on my arm
2832,"    “Won’t you come in, Nick"
2833,"”    “No, thanks"
2834,”    I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone
2835, But Jordan  lingered for a moment more
2836,"    “It’s only half-past nine,” she said"
2837,"    I’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day,  and suddenly that included Jordan too"
2838," She must have seen something of  this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the  porch steps into the house"
2839," I sat down for a few minutes with my head  in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s  voice calling a taxi"
2840," Then I walked slowly down the drive away from  the house, intending to wait by the gate"
2841,    I hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped  from between two bushes into the path
2842," I must have felt pretty weird  by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity  of his pink suit under the moon"
2843,    “What are you doing
2844,” I inquired
2845,"    “Just standing here, old sport"
2846,"”    Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation"
2847," For all I knew he was  going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn’t have been surprised to  see sinister faces, the faces of “Wolfshiem’s people,” behind him in  the dark shrubbery"
2848,    “Did you see any trouble on the road
2849,” he asked after a minute
2850,    “Yes
2851,”    He hesitated
2852,    “Was she killed
2853,”    “Yes
2854,”    “I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so
2855, It’s better that the shock  should all come at once
2856, She stood it pretty well
2857,”    He spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered
2858,"    “I got to West Egg by a side road,” he went on, “and left the car in  my garage"
2859," I don’t think anybody saw us, but of course I can’t be  sure"
2860,”    I disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to  tell him he was wrong
2861,    “Who was the woman
2862,” he inquired
2863,    “Her name was Wilson
2864, Her husband owns the garage
2865, How the devil did  it happen
2866,"”    “Well, I tried to swing the wheel—” He broke off, and suddenly I  guessed at the truth"
2867,    “Was Daisy driving
2868,"”    “Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course I’ll say I was"
2869," You see,  when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would  steady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were  passing a car coming the other way"
2870," It all happened in a minute, but  it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were  somebody she knew"
2871," Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward  the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back"
2872, The second  my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her  instantly
2873,"”    “It ripped her open—”    “Don’t tell me, old sport"
2874,” He winced
2875, “Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it
2876," I  tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency  brake"
2877, Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on
2878,"    “She’ll be all right tomorrow,” he said presently"
2879, “I’m just going to  wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness  this afternoon
2880," She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries  any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again"
2881,"”    “He won’t touch her,” I said"
2882, “He’s not thinking about her
2883,"”    “I don’t trust him, old sport"
2884,”    “How long are you going to wait
2885,"”    “All night, if necessary"
2886," Anyhow, till they all go to bed"
2887,”    A new point of view occurred to me
2888, Suppose Tom found out that Daisy  had been driving
2889, He might think he saw a connection in it—he might  think anything
2890, I looked at the house; there were two or three bright  windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the ground  floor
2891,"    “You wait here,” I said"
2892, “I’ll see if there’s any sign of a  commotion
2893,"”    I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel  softly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps"
2894," The drawing-room curtains  were open, and I saw that the room was empty"
2895," Crossing the porch where  we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small  rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window"
2896," The blind  was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill"
2897,"    Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table,  with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of  ale"
2898," He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his  earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own"
2899, Once in a  while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement
2900,"    They weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the  ale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either"
2901," There was an unmistakable air  of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said  that they were conspiring together"
2902,    As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the  dark road toward the house
2903, Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in  the drive
2904,    “Is it all quiet up there
2905,” he asked anxiously
2906,"    “Yes, it’s all quiet"
2907,” I hesitated
2908, “You’d better come home and get  some sleep
2909,”    He shook his head
2910,    “I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed
2911," Good night, old sport"
2912,"”    He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his  scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of  the vigil"
2913, So I walked away and left him standing there in the  moonlight—watching over nothing
2914,"                                       VIII    I couldn’t sleep all night; a foghorn was groaning incessantly on the  Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage,  frightening dreams"
2915," Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby’s drive,  and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress—I felt that I  had something to tell him, something to warn him about, and morning  would be too late"
2916,"    Crossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was still open and he was  leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep"
2917,"    “Nothing happened,” he said wanly"
2918," “I waited, and about four o’clock  she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned  out the light"
2919,”    His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when  we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes
2920," We pushed aside  curtains that were like pavilions, and felt over innumerable feet of  dark wall for electric light switches—once I tumbled with a sort of  splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano"
2921," There was an inexplicable  amount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as though they  hadn’t been aired for many days"
2922," I found the humidor on an unfamiliar  table, with two stale, dry cigarettes inside"
2923," Throwing open the French  windows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking out into the darkness"
2924,"    “You ought to go away,” I said"
2925, “It’s pretty certain they’ll trace  your car
2926,"”    “Go away now, old sport"
2927,"”    “Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal"
2928,”    He wouldn’t consider it
2929, He couldn’t possibly leave Daisy until he  knew what she was going to do
2930, He was clutching at some last hope and  I couldn’t bear to shake him free
2931,"    It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with  Dan Cody—told it to me because “Jay Gatsby” had broken up like glass  against Tom’s hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played  out"
2932," I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without  reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy"
2933,    She was the first “nice” girl he had ever known
2934," In various unrevealed  capacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with  indiscernible barbed wire between"
2935, He found her excitingly  desirable
2936," He went to her house, at first with other officers from  Camp Taylor, then alone"
2937, It amazed him—he had never been in such a  beautiful house before
2938," But what gave it an air of breathless  intensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her  as his tent out at camp was to him"
2939," There was a ripe mystery about it,  a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other  bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its  corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already  in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s  shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely  withered"
2940," It excited him, too, that many men had already loved  Daisy—it increased her value in his eyes"
2941," He felt their presence all  about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still  vibrant emotions"
2942,    But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal  accident
2943," However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was  at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the  invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders"
2944, So he  made the most of his time
2945," He took what he could get, ravenously and  unscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took  her because he had no real right to touch her hand"
2946,"    He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under  false pretences"
2947," I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom  millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he  let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as  herself—that he was fully able to take care of her"
2948," As a matter of  fact, he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing  behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government  to be blown anywhere about the world"
2949,    But he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had  imagined
2950," He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but  now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a  grail"
2951," He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize  just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be"
2952," She vanished into her  rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing"
2953," He felt  married to her, that was all"
2954,"    When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless,  who was, somehow, betrayed"
2955, Her porch was bright with the bought  luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as  she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth
2956," She  had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming  than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and  mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many  clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the  hot struggles of the poor"
2957,"    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    “I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her,  old sport"
2958," I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she  didn’t, because she was in love with me too"
2959," She thought I knew a lot  because I knew different things from her … Well, there I was, way off  my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden  I didn’t care"
2960, What was the use of doing great things if I could have  a better time telling her what I was going to do
2961,"”    On the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his  arms for a long, silent time"
2962," It was a cold fall day, with fire in the  room and her cheeks flushed"
2963," Now and then she moved and he changed his  arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair"
2964," The afternoon  had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory  for the long parting the next day promised"
2965," They had never been closer  in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with  another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder  or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were  asleep"
2966,    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    He did extraordinarily well in the war
2967," He was a captain before he  went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his  majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns"
2968," After the  armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or  misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead"
2969, He was worried now—there  was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters
2970, She didn’t see  why he couldn’t come
2971," She was feeling the pressure of the world  outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her  and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all"
2972,"    For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids  and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of  the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new  tunes"
2973, All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the  “Beale Street Blues” while a hundred pairs of golden and silver  slippers shuffled the shining dust
2974," At the grey tea hour there were  always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever,  while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the  sad horns around the floor"
2975,"    Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the  season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with  half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and  chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor  beside her bed"
2976, And all the time something within her was crying for a  decision
2977," She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision  must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable  practicality—that was close at hand"
2978,    That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom  Buchanan
2979," There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his  position, and Daisy was flattered"
2980, Doubtless there was a certain  struggle and a certain relief
2981, The letter reached Gatsby while he was  still at Oxford
2982,"    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of  the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning,  gold-turning light"
2983, The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew  and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves
2984," There was a  slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool,  lovely day"
2985,    “I don’t think she ever loved him
2986,” Gatsby turned around from a window  and looked at me challengingly
2987," “You must remember, old sport, she was  very excited this afternoon"
2988, He told her those things in a way that  frightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap  sharper
2989, And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying
2990,”    He sat down gloomily
2991,"    “Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were  first married—and loved me more even then, do you see"
2992,”    Suddenly he came out with a curious remark
2993,"    “In any case,” he said, “it was just personal"
2994,"”    What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his  conception of the affair that couldn’t be measured"
2995,"    He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their  wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to  Louisville on the last of his army pay"
2996," He stayed there a week,  walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through  the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which  they had driven in her white car"
2997," Just as Daisy’s house had always  seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea  of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded  with a melancholy beauty"
2998,"    He left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found  her—that he was leaving her behind"
2999, The day-coach—he was penniless  now—was hot
3000," He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a  folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar  buildings moved by"
3001," Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow  trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have  seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street"
3002,"    The track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it  sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing  city where she had drawn her breath"
3003," He stretched out his hand  desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of  the spot that she had made lovely for him"
3004," But it was all going by too  fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part  of it, the freshest and the best, forever"
3005,    It was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the  porch
3006, The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there  was an autumn flavour in the air
3007," The gardener, the last one of  Gatsby’s former servants, came to the foot of the steps"
3008,"    “I’m going to drain the pool today, Mr"
3009, Gatsby
3010," Leaves’ll start  falling pretty soon, and then there’s always trouble with the pipes"
3011,"”    “Don’t do it today,” Gatsby answered"
3012, He turned to me apologetically
3013,"  “You know, old sport, I’ve never used that pool all summer"
3014,”    I looked at my watch and stood up
3015,    “Twelve minutes to my train
3016,”    I didn’t want to go to the city
3017," I wasn’t worth a decent stroke of  work, but it was more than that—I didn’t want to leave Gatsby"
3018," I  missed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away"
3019,"    “I’ll call you up,” I said finally"
3020,"    “Do, old sport"
3021,”    “I’ll call you about noon
3022,”    We walked slowly down the steps
3023,    “I suppose Daisy’ll call too
3024,"” He looked at me anxiously, as if he  hoped I’d corroborate this"
3025,    “I suppose so
3026,"”    “Well, goodbye"
3027,”    We shook hands and I started away
3028, Just before I reached the hedge I  remembered something and turned around
3029,"    “They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted across the lawn"
3030, “You’re worth the  whole damn bunch put together
3031,”    I’ve always been glad I said that
3032," It was the only compliment I ever  gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end"
3033," First he  nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and  understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact  all the time"
3034," His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of  colour against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I  first came to his ancestral home, three months before"
3035," The lawn and  drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his  corruption—and he had stood on those steps, concealing his  incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye"
3036,    I thanked him for his hospitality
3037, We were always thanking him for  that—I and the others
3038,"    “Goodbye,” I called"
3039," “I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby"
3040,"”    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    Up in the city, I tried for a while to list the quotations on an  interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair"
3041,"  Just before noon the phone woke me, and I started up with sweat  breaking out on my forehead"
3042, It was Jordan Baker; she often called me  up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between  hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other  way
3043," Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool,  as if a divot from a green golf-links had come sailing in at the  office window, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry"
3044,"    “I’ve left Daisy’s house,” she said"
3045," “I’m at Hempstead, and I’m going  down to Southampton this afternoon"
3046,"”    Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy’s house, but the act  annoyed me, and her next remark made me rigid"
3047,    “You weren’t so nice to me last night
3048,”    “How could it have mattered then
3049,”    Silence for a moment
3050, Then:    “However—I want to see you
3051,"”    “I want to see you, too"
3052,"”    “Suppose I don’t go to Southampton, and come into town this  afternoon"
3053,”    “No—I don’t think this afternoon
3054,”    “Very well
3055,”    “It’s impossible this afternoon
3056," Various—”    We talked like that for a while, and then abruptly we weren’t talking  any longer"
3057," I don’t know which of us hung up with a sharp click, but I  know I didn’t care"
3058, I couldn’t have talked to her across a tea-table  that day if I never talked to her again in this world
3059,"    I called Gatsby’s house a few minutes later, but the line was busy"
3060, I  tried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was  being kept open for long distance from Detroit
3061," Taking out my  timetable, I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train"
3062, Then I  leaned back in my chair and tried to think
3063, It was just noon
3064,    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    When I passed the ash-heaps on the train that morning I had crossed  deliberately to the other side of the car
3065," I supposed there’d be a  curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark  spots in the dust, and some garrulous man telling over and over what  had happened, until it became less and less real even to him and he  could tell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson’s tragic achievement was  forgotten"
3066, Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at  the garage after we left there the night before
3067,"    They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine"
3068," She must have  broken her rule against drinking that night, for when she arrived she  was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had  already gone to Flushing"
3069," When they convinced her of this, she  immediately fainted, as if that was the intolerable part of the  affair"
3070," Someone, kind or curious, took her in his car and drove her in  the wake of her sister’s body"
3071,"    Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front  of the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on  the couch inside"
3072," For a while the door of the office was open, and  everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it"
3073,"  Finally someone said it was a shame, and closed the door"
3074," Michaelis  and several other men were with him; first, four or five men, later  two or three men"
3075," Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger  to wait there fifteen minutes longer, while he went back to his own  place and made a pot of coffee"
3076," After that, he stayed there alone with  Wilson until dawn"
3077,    About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent muttering  changed—he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car
3078," He  announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car  belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his  wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose  swollen"
3079,"    But when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry “Oh,  my God"
3080,” again in his groaning voice
3081, Michaelis made a clumsy attempt  to distract him
3082,"    “How long have you been married, George"
3083," Come on there, try and sit  still a minute, and answer my question"
3084, How long have you been  married
3085,”    “Twelve years
3086,”    “Ever had any children
3087," Come on, George, sit still—I asked you a  question"
3088, Did you ever have any children
3089,"”    The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, and  whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it  sounded to him like the car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before"
3090,"  He didn’t like to go into the garage, because the work bench was  stained where the body had been lying, so he moved uncomfortably  around the office—he knew every object in it before morning—and from  time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet"
3091,"    “Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George"
3092, Maybe even if you  haven’t been there for a long time
3093," Maybe I could call up the church  and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see"
3094,”    “Don’t belong to any
3095,"”    “You ought to have a church, George, for times like this"
3096, You must  have gone to church once
3097, Didn’t you get married in a church
3098," Listen,  George, listen to me"
3099, Didn’t you get married in a church
3100,”    “That was a long time ago
3101,”    The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking—for a moment  he was silent
3102," Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came  back into his faded eyes"
3103,"    “Look in the drawer there,” he said, pointing at the desk"
3104,    “Which drawer
3105,”    “That drawer—that one
3106,”    Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand
3107," There was nothing in it  but a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided  silver"
3108, It was apparently new
3109,    “This
3110,"” he inquired, holding it up"
3111,    Wilson stared and nodded
3112,    “I found it yesterday afternoon
3113," She tried to tell me about it, but I  knew it was something funny"
3114,”    “You mean your wife bought it
3115,”    “She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau
3116,"”    Michaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen  reasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash"
3117," But conceivably  Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle,  because he began saying “Oh, my God"
3118,” again in a whisper—his comforter  left several explanations in the air
3119,"    “Then he killed her,” said Wilson"
3120, His mouth dropped open suddenly
3121,    “Who did
3122,”    “I have a way of finding out
3123,"”    “You’re morbid, George,” said his friend"
3124, “This has been a strain to  you and you don’t know what you’re saying
3125, You’d better try and sit  quiet till morning
3126,”    “He murdered her
3127,"”    “It was an accident, George"
3128,”    Wilson shook his head
3129, His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened  slightly with the ghost of a superior “Hm
3130,"”    “I know,” he said definitely"
3131," “I’m one of these trusting fellas and I  don’t think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know  it"
3132, It was the man in that car
3133, She ran out to speak to him and he  wouldn’t stop
3134,"”    Michaelis had seen this too, but it hadn’t occurred to him that there  was any special significance in it"
3135, He believed that Mrs
3136," Wilson had  been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any  particular car"
3137,    “How could she of been like that
3138,"”    “She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as if that answered the question"
3139,"  “Ah-h-h—”    He began to rock again, and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his  hand"
3140,"    “Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George"
3141,”    This was a forlorn hope—he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend:  there was not enough of him for his wife
3142," He was glad a little later  when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window,  and realized that dawn wasn’t far off"
3143, About five o’clock it was blue  enough outside to snap off the light
3144,"    Wilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ash-heaps, where small grey  clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the  faint dawn wind"
3145,"    “I spoke to her,” he muttered, after a long silence"
3146, “I told her she  might fool me but she couldn’t fool God
3147," I took her to the  window”—with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and  leaned with his face pressed against it—“and I said ‘God knows what  you’ve been doing, everything you’ve been doing"
3148," You may fool me, but  you can’t fool God"
3149,"’ ”    Standing behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at  the eyes of Doctor T"
3150, J
3151," Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and  enormous, from the dissolving night"
3152,"    “God sees everything,” repeated Wilson"
3153,"    “That’s an advertisement,” Michaelis assured him"
3154, Something made him  turn away from the window and look back into the room
3155," But Wilson  stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding  into the twilight"
3156,"    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    By six o’clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a  car stopping outside"
3157," It was one of the watchers of the night before  who had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which  he and the other man ate together"
3158," Wilson was quieter now, and  Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and  hurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone"
3159,"    His movements—he was on foot all the time—were afterward traced to  Port Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill, where he bought a sandwich that  he didn’t eat, and a cup of coffee"
3160," He must have been tired and  walking slowly, for he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon"
3161," Thus far  there was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who  had seen a man “acting sort of crazy,” and motorists at whom he stared  oddly from the side of the road"
3162, Then for three hours he disappeared  from view
3163," The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis,  that he “had a way of finding out,” supposed that he spent that time  going from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car"
3164," On  the other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and  perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to  know"
3165," By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the  way to Gatsby’s house"
3166, So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name
3167,    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    At two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the  butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the  pool
3168," He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had  amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him to  pump it up"
3169," Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be  taken out under any circumstances—and this was strange, because the  front right fender needed repair"
3170,    Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool
3171," Once he  stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he  needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among  the yellowing trees"
3172,"    No telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleep  and waited for it until four o’clock—until long after there was anyone  to give it to if it came"
3173," I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t  believe it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared"
3174," If that was  true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a  high price for living too long with a single dream"
3175, He must have  looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered  as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight  was upon the scarcely created grass
3176," A new world, material without  being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted  fortuitously about … like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward  him through the amorphous trees"
3177,    The chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s protégés—heard the  shots—afterwards he could only say that he hadn’t thought anything  much about them
3178, I drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s house  and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that  alarmed anyone
3179," But they knew then, I firmly believe"
3180," With scarcely a  word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I hurried  down to the pool"
3181,"    There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the  fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other"
3182,"  With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden  mattress moved irregularly down the pool"
3183, A small gust of wind that  scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental  course with its accidental burden
3184," The touch of a cluster of leaves  revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red  circle in the water"
3185,"    It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener  saw Wilson’s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was  complete"
3186,"                                        IX    After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and  the next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and  newspaper men in and out of Gatsby’s front door"
3187," A rope stretched  across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but  little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and  there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the  pool"
3188," Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the  expression “madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and  the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper  reports next morning"
3189,"    Most of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial,  eager, and untrue"
3190," When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought  to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale  would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might  have said anything, didn’t say a word"
3191," She showed a surprising amount  of character about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes  under that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never  seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband,  that her sister had been into no mischief whatever"
3192," She convinced  herself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very  suggestion was more than she could endure"
3193, So Wilson was reduced to a  man “deranged by grief” in order that the case might remain in its  simplest form
3194, And it rested there
3195,    But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential
3196," I found myself  on Gatsby’s side, and alone"
3197," From the moment I telephoned news of the  catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every  practical question, was referred to me"
3198," At first I was surprised and  confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or  speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because  no one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense  personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end"
3199,"    I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her  instinctively and without hesitation"
3200," But she and Tom had gone away  early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them"
3201,    “Left no address
3202,”    “No
3203,”    “Say when they’d be back
3204,”    “No
3205,”    “Any idea where they are
3206, How I could reach them
3207,”    “I don’t know
3208, Can’t say
3209,”    I wanted to get somebody for him
3210," I wanted to go into the room where  he lay and reassure him: “I’ll get somebody for you, Gatsby"
3211, Don’t  worry
3212, Just trust me and I’ll get somebody for you—”    Meyer Wolfshiem’s name wasn’t in the phone book
3213," The butler gave me  his office address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the  time I had the number it was long after five, and no one answered the  phone"
3214,    “Will you ring again
3215,”    “I’ve rung three times
3216,”    “It’s very important
3217,”    “Sorry
3218, I’m afraid no one’s there
3219,"”    I went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they  were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled  it"
3220," But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with  shocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:    “Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get somebody for me"
3221, You’ve got  to try hard
3222, I can’t go through this alone
3223,"”    Someone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going  upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he’d  never told me definitely that his parents were dead"
3224," But there was  nothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence,  staring down from the wall"
3225,"    Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem,  which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next  train"
3226, That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it
3227," I was sure  he’d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there’d be a  wire from Daisy before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr"
3228, Wolfshiem  arrived; no one arrived except more police and photographers and  newspaper men
3229," When the butler brought back Wolfshiem’s answer I began  to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby  and me against them all"
3230,     Dear Mr
3231, Carraway
3232, This has been one of the most terrible shocks of   my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all
3233, Such a   mad act as that man did should make us all think
3234, I cannot come down   now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get   mixed up in this thing now
3235, If there is anything I can do a little   later let me know in a letter by Edgar
3236, I hardly know where I am when   I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and   out
3237,                                   Yours truly                                 Meyer Wolfshiem    and then hasty addenda beneath:     Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all
3238,    When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was  calling I thought this would be Daisy at last
3239," But the connection came  through as a man’s voice, very thin and far away"
3240,    “This is Slagle speaking …”    “Yes
3241,” The name was unfamiliar
3242,"    “Hell of a note, isn’t it"
3243, Get my wire
3244,”    “There haven’t been any wires
3245,"”    “Young Parke’s in trouble,” he said rapidly"
3246, “They picked him up when  he handed the bonds over the counter
3247, They got a circular from New  York giving ’em the numbers just five minutes before
3248," What d’you know  about that, hey"
3249, You never can tell in these hick towns—”    “Hello
3250,” I interrupted breathlessly
3251, “Look here—this isn’t Mr
3252,  Gatsby
3253, Mr
3254, Gatsby’s dead
3255,"”    There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an  exclamation … then a quick squawk as the connection was broken"
3256,    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C
3257, Gatz  arrived from a town in Minnesota
3258, It said only that the sender was  leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came
3259,"    It was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man, very helpless and dismayed,  bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day"
3260," His  eyes leaked continuously with excitement, and when I took the bag and  umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse  grey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat"
3261," He was on  the point of collapse, so I took him into the music-room and made him  sit down while I sent for something to eat"
3262," But he wouldn’t eat, and  the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand"
3263,"    “I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,” he said"
3264, “It was all in the  Chicago newspaper
3265, I started right away
3266,”    “I didn’t know how to reach you
3267,"”    His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room"
3268,"    “It was a madman,” he said"
3269, “He must have been mad
3270,”    “Wouldn’t you like some coffee
3271,” I urged him
3272,    “I don’t want anything
3273," I’m all right now, Mr"
3274,—”    “Carraway
3275,"”    “Well, I’m all right now"
3276, Where have they got Jimmy
3277,"”    I took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him  there"
3278," Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into  the hall; when I told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly  away"
3279,    After a little while Mr
3280," Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth  ajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and  unpunctual tears"
3281," He had reached an age where death no longer has the  quality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the  first time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great  rooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be  mixed with an awed pride"
3282, I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he  took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been  deferred until he came
3283,"    “I didn’t know what you’d want, Mr"
3284, Gatsby—”    “Gatz is my name
3285,”    “—Mr
3286, Gatz
3287, I thought you might want to take the body West
3288,”    He shook his head
3289,    “Jimmy always liked it better down East
3290, He rose up to his position in  the East
3291," Were you a friend of my boy’s, Mr"
3292,—
3293,”    “We were close friends
3294,"”    “He had a big future before him, you know"
3295," He was only a young man,  but he had a lot of brain power here"
3296,"”    He touched his head impressively, and I nodded"
3297,"    “If he’d of lived, he’d of been a great man"
3298, A man like James J
3299,  Hill
3300, He’d of helped build up the country
3301,"”    “That’s true,” I said, uncomfortably"
3302,"    He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the  bed, and lay down stiffly—was instantly asleep"
3303,"    That night an obviously frightened person called up, and demanded to  know who I was before he would give his name"
3304,    “This is Mr
3305," Carraway,” I said"
3306,    “Oh
3307,” He sounded relieved
3308, “This is Klipspringer
3309,"”    I was relieved too, for that seemed to promise another friend at  Gatsby’s grave"
3310," I didn’t want it to be in the papers and draw a  sightseeing crowd, so I’d been calling up a few people myself"
3311, They  were hard to find
3312,"    “The funeral’s tomorrow,” I said"
3313," “Three o’clock, here at the house"
3314,  I wish you’d tell anybody who’d be interested
3315,"”    “Oh, I will,” he broke out hastily"
3316," “Of course I’m not likely to see  anybody, but if I do"
3317,”    His tone made me suspicious
3318,    “Of course you’ll be there yourself
3319,"”    “Well, I’ll certainly try"
3320," What I called up about is—”    “Wait a minute,” I interrupted"
3321, “How about saying you’ll come
3322,"”    “Well, the fact is—the truth of the matter is that I’m staying with  some people up here in Greenwich, and they rather expect me to be with  them tomorrow"
3323," In fact, there’s a sort of picnic or something"
3324, Of  course I’ll do my best to get away
3325,”    I ejaculated an unrestrained “Huh
3326,"” and he must have heard me, for he  went on nervously:    “What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there"
3327, I wonder if  it’d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on
3328," You see,  they’re tennis shoes, and I’m sort of helpless without them"
3329, My  address is care of B
3330, F
3331,"—”    I didn’t hear the rest of the name, because I hung up the receiver"
3332,    After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby—one gentleman to whom I  telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved
3333," However, that was  my fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at  Gatsby on the courage of Gatsby’s liquor, and I should have known  better than to call him"
3334,    The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer  Wolfshiem; I couldn’t seem to reach him any other way
3335," The door that I  pushed open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked “The  Swastika Holding Company,” and at first there didn’t seem to be anyone  inside"
3336," But when I’d shouted “hello” several times in vain, an  argument broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely Jewess  appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile  eyes"
3337,"    “Nobody’s in,” she said"
3338, “Mr
3339, Wolfshiem’s gone to Chicago
3340,"”    The first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to  whistle “The Rosary,” tunelessly, inside"
3341,    “Please say that Mr
3342, Carraway wants to see him
3343,"”    “I can’t get him back from Chicago, can I"
3344,"”    At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem’s, called “Stella"
3345,”  from the other side of the door
3346,"    “Leave your name on the desk,” she said quickly"
3347, “I’ll give it to him  when he gets back
3348,”    “But I know he’s there
3349,”    She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up  and down her hips
3350,"    “You young men think you can force your way in here any time,” she  scolded"
3351, “We’re getting sickantired of it
3352," When I say he’s in Chicago,  he’s in Chicago"
3353,”    I mentioned Gatsby
3354,    “Oh-h
3355,” She looked at me over again
3356, “Will you just—What was your  name
3357,”    She vanished
3358," In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the  doorway, holding out both hands"
3359," He drew me into his office, remarking  in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered  me a cigar"
3360,"    “My memory goes back to when first I met him,” he said"
3361, “A young major  just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war
3362,  He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he  couldn’t buy some regular clothes
3363, First time I saw him was when he  came into Winebrenner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a  job
3364, He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days
3365," ‘Come on have some  lunch with me,’ I said"
3366, He ate more than four dollars’ worth of food  in half an hour
3367,”    “Did you start him in business
3368,” I inquired
3369,    “Start him
3370, I made him
3371,”    “Oh
3372,"”    “I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter"
3373," I saw right  away he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told  me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good"
3374, I got him to join  the American Legion and he used to stand high there
3375, Right off he did  some work for a client of mine up to Albany
3376, We were so thick like  that in everything”—he held up two bulbous fingers—“always together
3377,”    I wondered if this partnership had included the World’s Series  transaction in 1919
3378,"    “Now he’s dead,” I said after a moment"
3379," “You were his closest friend,  so I know you’ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon"
3380,”    “I’d like to come
3381,"”    “Well, come then"
3382,"”    The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head  his eyes filled with tears"
3383,"    “I can’t do it—I can’t get mixed up in it,” he said"
3384,    “There’s nothing to get mixed up in
3385, It’s all over now
3386,”    “When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any  way
3387, I keep out
3388," When I was a young man it was different—if a friend  of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end"
3389," You may  think that’s sentimental, but I mean it—to the bitter end"
3390,"”    I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come,  so I stood up"
3391,    “Are you a college man
3392,” he inquired suddenly
3393,"    For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a “gonnegtion,” but he  only nodded and shook my hand"
3394,"    “Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and  not after he is dead,” he suggested"
3395, “After that my own rule is to let  everything alone
3396,”    When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West  Egg in a drizzle
3397, After changing my clothes I went next door and found  Mr
3398, Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall
3399, His pride in his  son and in his son’s possessions was continually increasing and now he  had something to show me
3400,    “Jimmy sent me this picture
3401,” He took out his wallet with trembling  fingers
3402, “Look there
3403,"”    It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty  with many hands"
3404, He pointed out every detail to me eagerly
3405, “Look  there
3406,” and then sought admiration from my eyes
3407, He had shown it so  often that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself
3408,    “Jimmy sent it to me
3409, I think it’s a very pretty picture
3410, It shows up  well
3411,”    “Very well
3412, Had you seen him lately
3413,”    “He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in  now
3414," Of course we was broke up when he run off from home, but I see  now there was a reason for it"
3415, He knew he had a big future in front of  him
3416, And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me
3417,"”    He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another  minute, lingeringly, before my eyes"
3418, Then he returned the wallet and  pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong  Cassidy
3419,"    “Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy"
3420, It just shows  you
3421,”    He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see
3422," On  the last flyleaf was printed the word schedule, and the date September  12, 1906"
3423, And underneath:        Rise from bed                                  6:00      a

3430,00 [crossed out] $3
3431,"00 per week      * Be better to parents    “I came across this book by accident,” said the old man"
3432," “It just  shows you, don’t it"
3433,”    “It just shows you
3434,”    “Jimmy was bound to get ahead
3435, He always had some resolves like this  or something
3436, Do you notice what he’s got about improving his mind
3437, He  was always great for that
3438," He told me I et like a hog once, and I beat  him for it"
3439,"”    He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then  looking eagerly at me"
3440, I think he rather expected me to copy down the  list for my own use
3441,"    A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing, and  I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars"
3442, So did  Gatsby’s father
3443," And as the time passed and the servants came in and  stood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously, and he  spoke of the rain in a worried, uncertain way"
3444," The minister glanced  several times at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to wait  for half an hour"
3445, But it wasn’t any use
3446, Nobody came
3447,"    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    About five o’clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery  and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate—first a motor hearse,  horribly black and wet, then Mr"
3448," Gatz and the minister and me in the  limousine, and a little later four or five servants and the postman  from West Egg, in Gatsby’s station wagon, all wet to the skin"
3449, As we  started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then  the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground
3450, I  looked around
3451, It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found  marvelling over Gatsby’s books in the library one night three months  before
3452,    I’d never seen him since then
3453," I don’t know how he knew about the  funeral, or even his name"
3454," The rain poured down his thick glasses, and  he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled  from Gatsby’s grave"
3455,"    I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already  too far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that  Daisy hadn’t sent a message or a flower"
3456," Dimly I heard someone murmur  “Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,” and then the owl-eyed  man said “Amen to that,” in a brave voice"
3457,    We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars
3458, Owl-eyes spoke  to me by the gate
3459,"    “I couldn’t get to the house,” he remarked"
3460,    “Neither could anybody else
3461,”    “Go on
3462,” He started
3463," “Why, my God"
3464, they used to go there by the  hundreds
3465,"”    He took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in"
3466,"    “The poor son-of-a-bitch,” he said"
3467,    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school  and later from college at Christmas time
3468," Those who went farther than  Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o’clock of a  December evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into  their own holiday gaieties, to bid them a hasty goodbye"
3469," I remember  the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-That’s and the  chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught  sight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: “Are you  going to the Ordways’"
3470, the Herseys’
3471, the Schultzes’
3472,” and the long  green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands
3473," And last the murky  yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St"
3474, Paul railroad looking  cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate
3475,"    When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow,  began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and  the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild  brace came suddenly into the air"
3476," We drew in deep breaths of it as we  walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware  of our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we  melted indistinguishably into it again"
3477,"    That’s my Middle West—not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede  towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street  lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly  wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow"
3478," I am part of that, a  little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent  from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are  still called through decades by a family’s name"
3479," I see now that this  has been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and  Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some  deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life"
3480,"    Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware  of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the  Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the  children and the very old—even then it had always for me a quality of  distortion"
3481," West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic  dreams"
3482," I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at  once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging  sky and a lustreless moon"
3483, In the foreground four solemn men in dress  suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a  drunken woman in a white evening dress
3484," Her hand, which dangles over  the side, sparkles cold with jewels"
3485, Gravely the men turn in at a  house—the wrong house
3486," But no one knows the woman’s name, and no one  cares"
3487,"    After Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted  beyond my eyes’ power of correction"
3488, So when the blue smoke of brittle  leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the  line I decided to come back home
3489,"    There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant  thing that perhaps had better have been let alone"
3490, But I wanted to  leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent  sea to sweep my refuse away
3491," I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and  around what had happened to us together, and what had happened  afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big  chair"
3492,"    She was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like  a good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the  colour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the  fingerless glove on her knee"
3493, When I had finished she told me without  comment that she was engaged to another man
3494," I doubted that, though  there were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I  pretended to be surprised"
3495," For just a minute I wondered if I wasn’t  making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up  to say goodbye"
3496,"    “Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jordan suddenly"
3497, “You threw  me over on the telephone
3498," I don’t give a damn about you now, but it  was a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while"
3499,”    We shook hands
3500,"    “Oh, and do you remember”—she added—“a conversation we had once about  driving a car"
3501,”    “Why—not exactly
3502,”    “You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver
3503,"  Well, I met another bad driver, didn’t I"
3504, I mean it was careless of me  to make such a wrong guess
3505," I thought you were rather an honest,  straightforward person"
3506, I thought it was your secret pride
3507,"”    “I’m thirty,” I said"
3508, “I’m five years too old to lie to myself and  call it honour
3509,”    She didn’t answer
3510," Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously  sorry, I turned away"
3511,    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan
3512," He was walking ahead  of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a  little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving  sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes"
3513, Just as  I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into  the windows of a jewellery store
3514," Suddenly he saw me and walked back,  holding out his hand"
3515,"    “What’s the matter, Nick"
3516, Do you object to shaking hands with me
3517,”    “Yes
3518, You know what I think of you
3519,"”    “You’re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly"
3520, “Crazy as hell
3521, I don’t know  what’s the matter with you
3522,"”    “Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say to Wilson that afternoon"
3523,"”    He stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about  those missing hours"
3524," I started to turn away, but he took a step after  me and grabbed my arm"
3525,"    “I told him the truth,” he said"
3526," “He came to the door while we were  getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren’t in  he tried to force his way upstairs"
3527, He was crazy enough to kill me if  I hadn’t told him who owned the car
3528, His hand was on a revolver in his  pocket every minute he was in the house—” He broke off defiantly
3529,  “What if I did tell him
3530, That fellow had it coming to him
3531," He threw  dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy’s, but he was a tough  one"
3532, He ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and never even  stopped his car
3533,"”    There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it  wasn’t true"
3534,"    “And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffering—look here, when  I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits  sitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby"
3535," By  God it was awful—”    I couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done  was, to him, entirely justified"
3536, It was all very careless and  confused
3537," They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up  things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their  vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let  other people clean up the mess they had made …    I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as  though I were talking to a child"
3538, Then he went into the jewellery  store to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff  buttons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever
3539,    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    Gatsby’s house was still empty when I left—the grass on his lawn had  grown as long as mine
3540," One of the taxi drivers in the village never  took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and  pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to  East Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story  about it all his own"
3541, I didn’t want to hear it and I avoided him when  I got off the train
3542,"    I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming,  dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still  hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden,  and the cars going up and down his drive"
3543," One night I did hear a  material car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps"
3544, But I  didn’t investigate
3545, Probably it was some final guest who had been away  at the ends of the earth and didn’t know that the party was over
3546,"    On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer,  I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once  more"
